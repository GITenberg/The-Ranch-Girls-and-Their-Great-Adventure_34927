<h2>The Ranch Girls and Their<br />
Great Adventure</h2>




<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>KENT HOUSE<br /><br /><br /></div>


<div class='cap'>THE deep-rutted English lane was
bordered with high box hedges. On
one side was a sloping park with trees
a century old and on the other side a wide
field filled with meadow grass and scarlet
poppies. It was in July.</div>

<p>"In all the world there is nothing so peaceful
as this English country, is there? It is like
another world when one first gets away from
the turmoil of New York."</p>

<p>The girl who said this was undoubtedly an
American, both in her manner and appearance,
although her dark hair and eyes and her
deep-toned olive skin were almost Spanish in
coloring.</p>

<p>Her companion&mdash;in spite of the fact that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
her costume was a typical English walking
one, a mixed brown tweed skirt, Norfolk
jacket and high boots,&mdash;was equally an American.
She smiled before replying.</p>

<p>"I don't know that I agree with you, Olive.
Of course that is what people from home
always say. Jim Colter declares he is half
asleep the entire time he is in England. But
that is because Americans, particularly my
beloved westerners, don't understand England
and the English. Things are not always
peaceful just because they are quiet. We
think so because we are noisy. Frank says
there was never more unrest."</p>

<p>But at this Lady Kent, who a number of
years ago was Jacqueline Ralston and one of
the four Ranch girls at Rainbow Lodge,
slipped her arm through her friend's, Olive
Van Mater's.</p>

<p>"But, Olive dear, for goodness sake don't
let us talk politics the day after your arrival.
It is so English. Sometimes I feel scarcely
fitted to play the part of an English 'Lady,'
now that Frank has come into the title of
'Lord' and is a member of Parliament. I
often long for a ride with Jim over my own
prairies to search for lost cattle." Lady
Kent laughed.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span></p>

<p>"Once a Ranch girl, always a Ranch girl,
so far as I'm concerned, Olive; and yet I'm
farther away from the old place than any of
you. But, tell me, what made you decide to
come abroad so suddenly without even writing?
I have had letters from everybody at
home except that lazy Frieda, and yet not
one with a suggestion of your trip in it. Tell
me about every member of my family&mdash;Ruth
and Jim and their babies and Jean and Ralph
and Frieda and her Professor. Funny, I
never can think of Frieda really being married.
You see, although it has been nearly four
years, I have never seen her since we went
over for the great event."</p>

<p>Jack ceased talking for a moment, for she
was still "Jack" to her own family and the
friends who knew her intimately. Olive
never had talked so much as the other Ranch
girls, but now it occurred to Jack that she was
asking a great many questions, without
allowing an opportunity for them to be
answered.</p>

<p>Olive turned, apparently to glance through
the opening in the hedge at the splendid mass
of colour in the field.</p>

<p>"Suppose we sit down a while, Jack," she
suggested. "Remember, I haven't had the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
English habit of walking for a long time.
You told me Frank's train would not get in
from London for another hour."</p>

<p>In spite of the fact that her tone was as
casual as she knew how to make it, her companion
understood at once.</p>

<p>"You have come to tell me bad news,
haven't you? and I never dreamed of it until
this instant. You have been brave, Olive."</p>

<p>In spite of her nervousness over having so
suddenly guessed the reason for her friend's
unexpected visit, Jack quietly looked about
for a comfortable resting place, remembering
that Olive had just had a long trip and was
never so strong as the other Ranch girls.</p>

<p>A few yards farther on a gate led into Kent
Park.</p>

<p>Lady Kent opened this and a moment or
two later the two friends were seated under
one of the great oak trees for which the Kent
estate was famous&mdash;the estate now presided
over by Jacqueline Ralston and the Frank
Kent, whom we once knew as a guest at a
neighboring ranch to the Ralstons' in Wyoming,
but who were now Lord and Lady Kent
of the county of Kent, England.</p>

<p>"Don't be frightened, Jack; my news
isn't so bad as you may think. At least I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
don't know just how bad it is," and Olive
smiled and then frowned the next moment.
"The truth of the matter is that Frieda
Ralston Russell has left her Professor. I
was out in Wyoming having a peaceful visit
at Rainbow Ranch when I received a mysterious
telegram from Frieda telling me to
come to her at once in New York city&mdash;not
in Chicago, where she was supposed to be safe
with her Professor husband. Of course I
went at once to her. In New York I found
a yellow-haired and not so miserable Frieda,
who calmly told me she had decided that
marriage was a failure. I could not find out
her special reasons for thinking so, but perhaps
she will tell you more herself, Jack.
She is coming to you on the next steamer,
only she preferred my first breaking the news
to you and Frank."</p>

<p>Jack whistled, after a boyish fashion of her
youth, which was not becoming to her present
age and position.</p>

<p>"And you came, Olive dear, all the way
across the ocean by yourself, just because
my spoiled small sister wished to save herself
the trouble of a confession? You are an
angel, Olive. And I am afraid it is Frieda's
selfishness&mdash;her remaining such a completely<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
spoiled young person&mdash;that may be the
answer to her present behavior. But I
thought her husband spoiled her more even
than her own family had in the past. Besides,
I can't imagine the Professor doing anything
wicked, can you, Olive? Oh dear, Frank
and I always opposed Frieda's marriage.
Professor Russell did seem too old and serious
for her."</p>

<p>Just as she had always done whenever it
was possible as a girl, Lady Kent at this
moment took off her hat and flung it on the
ground beside her. It was of brown cloth
with a small green and brown feather to
match her walking outfit; nevertheless she
looked far handsomer without it.</p>

<p>Jack was no longer a girl. A good many
years had passed since her marriage to Frank
Kent, which was to occur soon after the close
of the last Ranch girls' book, known as "The
Ranch Girls At Home Again." Also in the
final chapter, when the family had lately
moved into their new home, built on the
ranch not far from the old Rainbow Lodge,
where the Ranch girls had first lived, their
cousin Jean Bruce's engagement had been
announced to Ralph Merritt, an old friend
and the Rainbow Mine engineer. Then, as a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
great surprise to her family, Frieda Ralston,
the youngest of the Ranch girls, at that
time only eighteen, had insisted upon her
own engagement to Professor Charles Henry
Russell, a Professor of dead languages at the
University of Chicago and more than ten
years her senior.</p>

<p>"Oh, well, what is an old maid worth in a
family if she is not to be made useful?" Olive
answered. "But, of course, Jack, you understand
I don't require a great deal of persuasion
to come to you, and besides I was afraid if I
did not come ahead, Frieda would not come
at all. You are the only person who has any
influence over her. If she goes back to the
ranch, Ruth and Jean will only make such a
fuss over her that she will become more and
more convinced she has been badly treated.
Jim, you know, never has approved of any
of his Ranch girls being married, although
he misses none of us as he does you."</p>

<p>Jack rose. "I hope you are rested, Olive,
as we must walk on if we are to arrive in time
to meet Frank. Oh, dear, what a business
marriage is! I suppose we could not expect
all the Ranch girls to be successfully married,
although it is odd for it to be Frieda who is
in trouble. As for you, Olive, don't congratulate<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
yourself too soon on being an old
maid; you'll probably yield some day. I do
wonder what has happened to little Frieda?
Perhaps things are worse than we imagine."</p>

<p>Olive shook her head.</p>

<p>She was recalling an extremely pretty
Frieda sitting up in bed at midnight at the
hour of her arrival in New York city, with a
blue silk dressing gown over her nightgown
and a box of chocolates open on the table
beside her, which she must have been eating
before going to bed.</p>

<p>It was true Frieda had cried a good deal
when making her confession, and had insisted
that she never intended to speak to her husband
again. Why, Olive could not find out.
She gathered that Frieda thought her husband
unsympathetic and that their temperaments
were too unlike for them ever, ever to understand
each other. But the details of her
love tragedy Frieda had declared she could
tell only to her sister Jack.</p>

<p>Now, as Olive studied her companion's
face, she believed that Frieda had decided
wisely. When they were the four Ranch
girls, Jack, Jean, Olive and Frieda, they had
always relied upon Jacqueline Ralston's judgment.
Now, as a woman, she seemed even<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
finer than she had been as a girl. Well,
fortunately Jack's marriage seemed to have
turned out ideally happy, although there
were reasons why it might not. Jack had
never been fond of society or a conventional
life, had hated the indoors and the management
of even so small and casual an establishment
as they had at Rainbow Lodge before the
coming of Ruth as governess to take the
responsibility out of Jack's hands. Now
Jack was not only mistress of a great home,
but must play "Lady Bountiful" to an entire
village, as well as to the people on the Kent
estate, and she was really the most democratic
person in the world.</p>

<p>They were entering the adjoining village
of Granchester now and Lady Kent had
actually forgotten to put on her hat. Yet
all the people they met along the little narrow
streets bowed to her, as if she were not
unpopular. Several times Jack stopped to
inquire about sick babies and old ladies in
the most approved fashion. However, Olive
remembered that she had been great friends
with all the cowboys on her own ranch and
the adjoining ones in the old days, and was
interested in their families, when they chanced
to have them, which was not often. Nevertheless<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
this new life of her friend's did seem
extraordinarily different from her old life.</p>

<p>Only once since Jack's marriage had Olive
visited her and then only for a few weeks,
when her mother-in-law was alive and Frank's
sisters had not yet married. Therefore she
had never really seen Frank and Jack alone.</p>

<p>As they came to the little railroad station,
covered with roses and surrounded by flower
beds, Jack hastily put on her hat.</p>

<p>"Gracious! why didn't you tell me to do
that before, Olive?" she asked "I must have
looked ridiculous. Frank would have been
discouraged if he had seen me. After all,
you see, Olive, Frank is an Englishman and
fond of the proprieties. At least I don't
think he minds so much himself, but he does
not enjoy having the country people talk
about me, especially now that we have come
into the title."</p>

<p>"But they don't criticize you, do they?"
Olive demanded with a good deal of feeling.</p>

<p>However, Lady Kent only laughed, "Not
more than I deserve." And then forgetting
what she had just said, she took off her hat
for the second time to wave it boyishly at the
approaching train.</p>

<p>The next moment Frank Kent jumped out<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
on the platform. He had changed much more
than his wife. Olive saw that he took his
new position and his responsibilities seriously,
for he had only come into the title two years
before. He looked far more like what one
feels to be the typical Englishman, as he had
an air of distinction and of firmness. Indeed,
Olive thought he had almost a hardness in the
lower part of his face which had not been
there as a younger man. But he greeted her
with the same old cordiality and friendliness.</p>

<p>"You and I seem often to meet Frank at
railroad stations, Olive," Jack remarked.
"Remember when he last came to Wyoming
before we were married and we went together
to meet him?"</p>

<p>Frank appeared so uncertain that Jack
laughed.</p>

<p>"Husbands haven't very good memories
for the sentimental past."</p>

<p>The next instant Frank protested.</p>

<p>"Of course I remember and how badly you
treated me, Jack, so that Olive had to come
to my rescue." And then: "Did you drive
over? Where is the trap?"</p>

<p>Lady Kent shook her head. "No; Olive
and I wanted a walk and it is much better for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
you. If you don't look out we shall both be
growing as portly as a dowager duke and
duchess."</p>

<p>Jack was a few steps ahead so that both her
friend and husband looked at her admiringly,
Olive appreciating, however, that Frank would
have preferred his own wish to be carried out
in this matter.</p>

<p>But it had always been a pleasure to see
Jacqueline Ralston out-of-doors and it was
no less so now. Although she now had two
babies she had managed to keep as slender
and erect as a girl&mdash;a most unusual characteristic
in a woman.</p>

<p>Jack was walking on ahead so freely and so
unconscious of her own speed that the others
had to hurry to catch up with her.</p>

<p>When they finally joined one another,
Frank slipped his arm through his wife's.</p>

<p>"Oh, I have a piece of news for you, dear.
I forgot to tell you. I had a cable from
Frieda's husband telling me that he expected
to sail for England in about ten days. He did
not give his reason, nor mention Frieda's
coming with him."</p>

<p>"No," Lady Kent answered apparently
in a state of abstraction, "I don't suppose
he did." But at the moment she made no<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
mention of the information Olive had brought
her concerning Frieda.</p>

<p>As they reached Kent House and were
entering the broad hall, Jack said to her
husband under her breath, so that Olive who
was a little in advance of them, did not hear:</p>

<p>"There is something else you have on your
mind, isn't there, Frank&mdash;some news you
have not yet told me?"</p>

<p>Frank Kent nodded.</p>

<p>"Yes, Jack, something so serious that I
dare not speak of it even to you. Perhaps
it will all blow over though, and I may be
able to discuss the subject with you in a few
days."</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>FRIEDA'S RIFT<br /><br /><br /></div>


<div class='cap'>"DID Frieda say on what ship she
would sail? It is odd she does
not cable."</div>

<p>The two friends were coming down from the
third floor of Kent House where the babies'
nurseries were. Jack and Frank had two
children&mdash;the oldest a small boy, something
over three years old, and called Jimmie, in
honor of Jim Colter, the Ranch Girls' guardian
and the one-time overseer and now part owner
of the Rainbow Ranch. The baby, who was
only a year old, had been named for Olive
Van Mater, who had never seen her until her
present visit. But there would be no confusion
of names, for almost immediately the
small brother had rechristened his tiny sister
with the charming little name "Vive," which
was used for her always. And since Vive was
the gayest and liveliest of babies, this name
with its translated meaning, "Life" was
supposed to be particularly appropriate.</p>

<p>"No, Frieda did not say," Olive Van<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
Mater returned. "But I presume she will
cable in a day or so. Frieda will expect you
to be in London to meet her. I am sure she
will feel much aggrieved if you do not, but I
think I won't come along, Jack, if I may stay
with the babies."</p>

<p>Lady Kent opened the door of a room.</p>

<p>"Just as you like, Olive, only I hope Frieda
will let me know in time. Frank is in London
most of the week while Parliament is in
session, and I'll have to ask him to make
arrangements for us. The season is over, of
course, but the hotels are filled with tourists.
It has been a wonderful English summer.
I don't think there were ever more travelers.
Well, Frieda's rooms are at least ready for her.
I hope she may enjoy having the same ones
she had when she came over to visit the first
year after Frank and I were married. I
wonder if she ever thinks these days of how
hard I tried to persuade her to believe she was
too much of a baby to think of marrying so
soon? We should never have allowed her to
marry the first person who ever seriously
asked her. Oh, I know Frieda thought she
had already had a great deal of experience
with her college boy admirers, particularly the
one we used to call 'The Chocolate Drop Boy.'"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p>

<p>In the meantime the two women had
entered the apartment which was being
reserved for the expected visitor. The two
rooms&mdash;a sitting room and a bed room&mdash;were
furnished in heavy, old fashioned English
furniture upholstered in delicately faded blue
damask. The walls were also of the same
blue, while the panelings of the rooms were of
English oak.</p>

<p>Olive walked at once to a window in Frieda's
sitting room.</p>

<p>"I don't see how she can well help liking
these rooms, besides this window offers one
of the most perfect views in the entire house."</p>

<p>Olive could see across the slope of the park
down to a stream, which twisted its way along
the base of the hill. Beyond were the tall
towers of Granchester church and not far
away the roofs of the houses which made up
the village.</p>

<p>Then, to the left, one could acquire a
charming view of the beginning of the Kent
gardens&mdash;the low, carefully trimmed borders
and the masses of blooms, with a sun dial at
the end of the center path.</p>

<p>"Let us go into the garden for awhile,
Jack," Olive suggested. "I think I enjoy
it more in the morning than at any other<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
time. Besides, I have been intending to ask
if you suppose Frieda and her husband have
informed each other that they are both sailing
for England? It will be odd to have them
meet each other here unless they do know."</p>

<p>Jack shook her head. "I haven't any ideas
on the subject, but Frank will have to see that
Professor Russell stays in London until we
find out from Frieda. Sorry, but I can't go
outdoors with you till this afternoon. I've
hundreds of things to do and have promised
Frank to write some letters which I have been
putting off."</p>

<p>In return Olive said nothing, although, as
she was walking about outdoors alone, she
rather marveled at the change in her friend's
life. As a girl Jacqueline Ralston's life had
been entirely unordered; she had done each
day, after the sun rose over her beloved
prairies, whatever the day called her to do.
Now, each of Jack's days seemed to follow
an established routine. In the morning
immediately after breakfast she saw her
housekeeper; then she spent two hours with
her babies, afterwards answering an immense
amount of correspondence&mdash;and Jack had
always hated letter writing more than any
other task. In the afternoon she was supposed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
to be free for a few hours, and then
there were guests to tea, or else Lady Kent
was supposed to drive or motor over to make
calls on her country neighbors.</p>

<p>Of course such an existence with money
and a high position might be regarded as
ideal by most women. But Olive was puzzled,
because that kind of a life did not appear
suited to the girl she remembered. However,
as Jack seemed happy, Olive concluded that
she must have changed, as most girls do
after marriage.</p>

<p>This afternoon a number of friends had
been asked to tea at Kent House in order to
meet Olive. When they went down into the
garden together, where tea was to be served,
Olive felt that her decision of the morning
had really been nearer the truth than she
had then appreciated. Jack looked like one
of the fairest types of society women. She
was dressed in white&mdash;an exquisite embroidered
material&mdash;and had on a big soft white
garden hat, trimmed with deep toned pink
roses. The soft, damp English air had kept
her color as vivid as ever and given her yellow
brown hair an even finer gloss.</p>

<p>On their way to the tea table in the garden,
Jack stopped to pick for her companion a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
bouquet of lavender primroses and <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'anenomes'">anemones</ins>
and stars of the mist&mdash;flowers ranging from
violet to pure white&mdash;for Olive was wearing a
pale grey chiffon, which blended perfectly
with her pronounced oriental coloring.</p>

<p>To the right of the garden, and a few yards
from the flower beds, was a clump of trees.
Because this July was warmer than is usual
in England, Lady Kent had arranged to have
tea here. There were small tables and chairs
scattered about over the lawn, which was
green as only an English lawn can be, but
the tea table itself stood under the trees.</p>

<p>Jack and Olive had hoped to have a talk
before their guests arrived. But they had
not been outdoors more than a few moments
before their guests appeared, the Rector and
his wife, a Mr. and Mrs. Illington, and their
two daughters,&mdash;charming, tall, blonde English
girls. Afterwards, it seemed to Olive
that Jack was constantly introducing her to
people arriving every few minutes during
the next hour, in spite of the fact that she had
also to preside over the serving of the tea.</p>

<p>As Olive had never entirely recovered from
her girlhood shyness, she was delighted to see
how perfectly at ease Jack was. She appeared
to be able to discuss church matters with the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
Rector, and the latest bill up in Parliament
with an old gentleman who was the Earl of
Granchester and as a Conservative was much
opposed to the Liberal party of which Frank
Kent was a representative.</p>

<p>Half an hour later, Olive wandered off with
several of the guests to watch a game of
tennis which was being started by the two
Illington girls and two of their male friends
who had come over to play.</p>

<p>When Olive returned, she discovered that
most of the other guests had either scattered
or gone home. In any case Jack was alone,
except for a young army officer, who must
have just arrived, since Olive did not recall
having previously seen him. He was a
splendid looking fellow, about twenty-five,
with dark hair and eyes, and a skin which
must have been tanned by other than the
English sun.</p>

<p>As Olive approached them she thought he
made a particularly handsome contrast to
Jack's fairness. They were both laughing at
the moment, but almost immediately Jack
jumped up from the chair where she had been
sitting and waved to Olive.</p>

<p>"Olive, dear, come meet the nicest kind of
an Englishman&mdash;one who is half Scotch and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
the other half Irish," she called out. "Olive
Van Mater, this is Captain Bryan MacDonnell&mdash;an
old school friend of Frank's and sometimes
a friend of mine."</p>

<p>Captain MacDonnell bowed gravely,
making no effort to return Jack's challenge.</p>

<p>"Bryan is just back from shooting 'big
game' somewhere&mdash;make him tell you about
it, Olive, while I get rid of the last of these
tiresome people." Jack made a grimace and
shrugged her shoulders, her manner more
like her old self than Olive had noticed
before.</p>

<p>For about fifteen minutes she and Captain
MacDonnell must have talked together, but
Olive decided that Jack's description of him
had been very nearly true, whether she had
meant it or not. Then, observing that
everybody else had gone and Jack was alone,
they returned to her.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry you can't dine with us tonight,
Bryan," Lady Kent remarked on parting.
"Olive and I are to be alone. Frank only
visits his family now and then, because he is
so busy in town. No; I did not go up to
London this year for the season. I only went
for a few days at a time, as I was not willing
to leave the babies. Besides, you know I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
don't care as much for <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'soceity'">society</ins> as I should
anyway."</p>

<p>Then Captain MacDonnell said something
which Olive did not hear. However, she did
hear Jack's answer.</p>

<p>"Ride with you tomorrow? I should
think I will just as hard and as fast as possible
and jump all the fences and ditches in this
part of the country. I'm awfully glad you are
back, Bryan, to help me get rid of some of my
surplus American energy."</p>

<p>That same evening, after a late dinner,
Jack and Olive went into the library together.
As is often the case in English homes of distinction,
the library at Kent House was the
pleasantest room in the entire house. The
books were on low shelves encircling the four
walls, except for the opening left for a huge
fireplace. Above the mantel was the head
of a stag. On one side hung a shield and on
the other the Kent Coat of Arms with the
motto "Semper Paratus" meaning "always
prepared."</p>

<p>Above the book shelves were portraits of
Frank's ancestors, who had been country
people in Kent county for a number of years,
although the title was not an old one.</p>

<p>In the places of honor were Frank's grandfather<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
and grandmother&mdash;one of them a
young man of about twenty in Court costume;
the other a lovely girl with fair hair and dark
eyes and a particularly bright expression.</p>

<p>"Frank likes to think Vive, the baby, looks
like his grandmother," Jack declared as she
stretched herself on a big leather lounge not far
from a pair of French windows, which opened
on the veranda at the side of the house.</p>

<p>"I hope you won't feel dull, Olive! As soon
as Parliament closes, if you and Frieda like,
we will have some people come to stay with us.
I don't like the responsibility of visitors if
Frank is not here. I have never learned to
take guests so simply and easily as an English
hostess does. It is one of the ways in which
I am a social failure."</p>

<p>"Nonsense," Olive announced, without
paying much attention to what Jack had said.
She had picked up a magazine and was reading.</p>

<p>An hour passed and Olive believed that
Jack had almost fallen asleep. Now and then
she would close her eyes, although the greater
part of the time she seemed in a reverie.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact Jack was really thinking
of the old ranch and the people at home, whom
Olive's coming had brought to mind more
vividly than usual.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span></p>

<p>"I'm glad Jean and Ralph are at the ranch
this year with Ruth and Jim," she said finally.
"What a pleasure it must be to Jean that
Ralph is such a successful engineer&mdash;one of
the biggest in the United States, Jim writes.
But Jim always liked Ralph better than any
of the husbands. He never could altogether
forgive Frank for being an Englishman."</p>

<p>"Oh Ralph has not been at the ranch
much," Olive added, looking up from her
book. "He has been working out on the coast
and at Panama, but I think Jean is glad to
have a rest because she has traveled with him
so much."</p>

<p>In the ensuing silence Jack must actually
have dozed, and certainly Olive found a more
absorbing article in her magazine. But Jack
must also have dreamed, for she woke thinking
she heard a voice calling her from outdoors,
"Jack! Jack!"</p>

<p>This was, of course, out of the question
except in a dream. Kent House was a mile
from any place other than its own Lodge.
Besides no one whom she could possibly
imagine would call out "Jack!" in such a
fashion and at such an hour of the night.</p>

<p>Nevertheless Olive looked surprised, so she
too must have heard some kind of a noise.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span></p>

<p>The second time the sound was heard, Jack
started up.</p>

<p>"Please ring the bell for the servants,
Olive. I am sure I hear a voice calling me.
It sounds absurd and yet I must find out
who it is. Even if the servants insist this
house is haunted, no one has ever yet suggested
that the lawn is also haunted."</p>

<p>Then, in characteristic fashion, and without
putting a wrap over her white dress or waiting
for any one to accompany her, Jack ran
through the library and out into the broad
hall. There was no one near, so she pulled
open the heavy front door.</p>

<p>Leading up to Kent House was a winding
avenue of trees. At some little distance down
the avenue, Lady Kent thought she could
see a dark object apparently standing still in
the center of the road. Without pausing
even long enough for Olive to join her, she
ran through the darkness toward it.</p>

<p>"Jack! Jack! be careful!" she heard the
voice call, and this time she recognized whose
voice it was.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>THE VOICE<br /><br /><br /></div>


<div class='cap'>"BUT, Frieda, how could you possibly
have arranged to arrive in the
middle of the night like this?"</div>

<p>Jack had reached the waiting taxicab,
which stood transfixed in the middle of the
road and had pulled open the door of the
vehicle, only to find her sister sitting inside,
almost completely enveloped in steamer
blankets and bags and boxes.</p>

<p>"The cab broke down," Frieda remarked
plaintively, evidently attempting to explain
last conditions first. It seemed not to have
occurred to her that even in the event of this
difficulty, she could have gotten out and
walked up to the house. But it was eminently
characteristic of Frieda simply to sit
still and call for her sister, as she always had
done in any emergency when they were both
girls.</p>

<p>The next moment Lady Kent, with the
assistance of the driver, had helped her visitor
to alight. If Olive and the butler had not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
arrived just then, she might again have forgotten
her dignity and begun dragging out
Frieda's bags. But instead, she and Olive,
escorted Frieda up the avenue, leaving the
two men to bring her possessions.</p>

<p>"I was lonely after Olive left me in New
York," Frieda explained. "So when I read
in the paper one morning that a particularly
comfortable steamer was sailing, I decided not
to wait an entire week, if I could get a nice
stateroom. I thought Olive would not need
but a few days to tell you. You have told,
haven't you, Olive?" Frieda demanded, with
a slight change of tone.</p>

<p>When Olive answered "yes," briefly, she
went on:</p>

<p>"Please don't ask me any questions tonight,
Jack. I'm most dead. No; I didn't have a
rough crossing, but I have never arrived
anywhere alone before in my whole life. I
knew I could call up Frank at his club in
London, but I did not wish to see him first.
Still, I don't care what he thinks, since I have
lost all faith in men. But I don't see why
some one did not meet me at the station here.
I telegraphed from Liverpool that I was
on the way."</p>

<p>Jack shook her head.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span></p>

<p>"Curious dear, but we never received your
telegram."</p>

<p>"Oh, well;" Frieda added more indulgently,
"I didn't exactly telegraph myself,
but I gave the money to a boy and told him
what to say. Perhaps he made a mistake,
or kept the money, or something," she ended
nonchalantly. For they were now entering
the great hall at Kent House and Frieda
realized that she did not care very much for
small things, so grateful was she to be again
with her sister.</p>

<p>Impulsively she turned and embraced her.</p>

<p>Perhaps it was because Frieda was tired,
but Jack could see that she was not so
unaffected by what she had been passing
through as Olive had imagined.</p>

<p>It is true Frieda looked as much like an
exquisite wax doll as ever. Her eyes were as
large and delicately blue, and her hair was a
mass of soft yellow curls; yet there was a
subtle change in her expression.</p>

<p>Olive had led the way into the library.</p>

<p>"We won't talk about anything until you
like, Frieda," Jack whispered.</p>

<p>"Will you go up to your rooms now or have
something to eat first down here with Olive
and me?" she asked.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span></p>

<p>Frieda permitted Olive and Jack to remove
her coat and hat. A few moments later,
however, she announced that she preferred
going upstairs to bed. So Jack finally bade
her goodnight, after arranging that she was
to ring her bell for breakfast, when she wished
it the next morning.</p>

<p>When Frieda rang for breakfast it was
nearly eleven o'clock and Jack went into her
room with the maid who carried the tray.</p>

<p>Frieda ate her morning repast languidly,
while her sister sat beside her talking of
trivial things.</p>

<p>"Where is Olive?" Frieda inquired finally.
And when informed that Olive was in the
nursery with the children, protested: "I
suppose you know I am jealous of your baby's
being named for Olive. Of course I know you
and she are very dear friends; but, after all,
I am your sister."</p>

<p>"I felt that way about it too, Frieda,
but Frank seemed not to wish a German
name," Jack answered, "and Vive has her
own name now anyhow. Maybe the next
time."</p>

<p>Frieda frowned. "Don't talk of next time,
Jack. I can't imagine your having a family.
I hate being married." And without any<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
other warning two large tears rolled down
Frieda's cheeks.</p>

<p>"I'd rather tell you what has happened
between Henry and me this minute and get
through with it. And I'd prefer to tell you
without Olive's hearing. I don't mean to be
impolite, but Olive is almost an old maid and
old maids always take the man's part."</p>

<p>In spite of her anxiety Jack was compelled
to laugh. Frieda had always been such a
funny mixture of babyishness and worldly
wisdom.</p>

<p>She was now sitting up in bed with a number
of white pillows piled behind her and wearing
a light blue cashmere jacket over her gown.
The English air was cooler than that to which
she was accustomed.</p>

<p>"I hope nothing very serious, Frieda?"</p>

<p>"Nevertheless it is so serious that I never
intend to speak to Henry Russell again, if I
can avoid it. You see," Frieda sighed, "I
suppose it is better to begin at the beginning
and tell the whole thing. But, then, who
knows when anything actually begins? At
any rate during the first two years after Henry
and I were married you remember we lived
with Henry's parents. They were awfully
nice to me and gave me hundreds of presents,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
but after awhile I became tired of living in
another's house. Oh, the house was big
and I had plenty of rooms, but you know it
isn't like having a home of one's own is it,
Jack?"</p>

<p>After waiting for her sister to nod agreement,
Frieda went on.</p>

<p>"So I told Henry I wanted a house to
myself, and I must say he and his mother and
father were very nice about it&mdash;at first."
Frieda made a dramatic pause.</p>

<p>"It was Henry's fault all through though.
You know he is the only child and his mother
and father are dreadfully rich. But what do
you suppose Henry decided? When we went
to housekeeping for ourselves we were to live
on the income he made as a Professor! Did
you ever hear of anything so selfish?"</p>

<p>"Well dear," Jack hesitated "maybe in a
way it was selfish, because of course Henry's
father and mother must have been disappointed
not to be able to do for you. But,
after all, it was self respecting of Henry. I
suppose a man&mdash;especially an American one&mdash;likes
to feel that he is able to be responsible
for his own family."</p>

<p>"That is exactly what Ruth and Jim Colter
wrote me," Frieda protested indignantly.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
"I suppose it never occurs to any one of you
to think of me!"</p>

<p>"Yes, but you have your own income from
our estate, Frieda," Jack added quickly, not
wishing to offend her sister at the beginning
of her confidence.</p>

<p>"I know," Frieda continued more amiably.
"So, at first, when I saw how much Henry's
heart was set on our being independent, I
agreed to try. But you know, Jack, I never
have had much experience in managing money,
and even when we were at school at Primrose
Hall I got into debt. So, although Henry
told me just what we had to live upon, I
couldn't seem to make things come out even.
Then, as I didn't want to worry him, I kept
using my own income till that gave out.
And then&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Then what?" Jack inquired anxiously.
Really she had been right in disapproving of
Frieda's marrying so young. And more
important than Frieda's youth was the fact
that she, and all the people who had ever had
anything to do with Frieda, had never treated
her as a responsible human being. In her
entire life she had never had any real care, or
any real demand made upon her. Jack felt
deeply uneasy. But whatever had happened,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
whatever might happen in the future, Frieda
was her own adored small sister, and she
intended to stand by her.</p>

<p>"Oh nothing much," Frieda conceded,
although her voice was less self assured,
"only I told Henry's father. He used to be
very fond of me before I left Henry; I don't
know how he feels now," she murmured. "I
believe he thought I was some kind of a joke,
for he gave me a lot of money and told me not
to worry. But he told Henry's mother and
she did not think it was fair to Henry and
must have let him know. Anyhow he was
dreadfully angry and unkind to me."</p>

<p>"How unkind?" Jack demanded. For,
of course, the fear that Professor Russell had
been unkind to Frieda had been always at the
back of her mind, since learning of her sister's
unhappiness. However, when she recalled
the Professor's shyness and gentleness, it was
difficult to imagine him in the role of a brute.
But Jack had learned enough of life not
always to trust to exteriors.</p>

<p>"Oh, nothing very dreadful I suppose,"
Frieda conceded. "Henry fussed a lot and
said I had not been fair to him and that it
wasn't honest to keep things from him. He
was always saying that I was very young<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
and that I ought to confide everything in
him."</p>

<p>"Was there anything else, dear?" Jack
inquired gently.</p>

<p>Frieda nodded. "Yes. Oh, well, I might
as well tell you the whole story since I have
started. I was getting on a little better with
the house, and Henry obtained some extra
work to do, so that he made more money.
But it kept him at home more in the evenings
and besides he never did like to go out a great
deal. He used to go sometimes because I liked
it, but I never felt he was enjoying himself,
and Henry never would learn to dance."</p>

<p>This struck Jack as a perfectly absurd reason
for a vital difference between a husband and
wife, yet she dared not smile, nor did she
wish to smile, seeing how important this
really appeared to Frieda.</p>

<p>But Frieda must have understood something
of what was passing in her sister's mind,
for she said:</p>

<p>"I know that may sound ridiculous to you,
Jack, but it has made a lot of difference to
me." There was a choking note in Frieda's
voice. "A lot of our trouble has come from it.
You know I dearly love to dance, so I used
to go out in the afternoons as I didn't like<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
staying at home by myself and did not want
to trouble Henry to take me often."</p>

<p>"Not by yourself?"</p>

<p>"Certainly not," Frieda returned pettishly,
"one can't very well dance alone."</p>

<p>"With any particular person?"</p>

<p>For a moment Jack held her breath.</p>

<p>At first Frieda shook her head. Afterwards
she contradicted herself and nodded.</p>

<p>"There were three or four persons&mdash;young
fellows&mdash;some of them students at the University,
and most of the time other girls, too.
At first Henry did not mind. Then he said
people were beginning to talk and there was
one person I liked especially, because he
danced better than any one else, whom Henry
said I could not go with at all. But I did go.
Then I told Henry I was bored anyhow and
wanted to be free. He was very disagreeable.
So I ran away and just left a note. But I
haven't been very happy for a long time,
Jack, darling. I suppose you were right when
you said I ought not to have married so
young. Perhaps I am spoiled and selfish.
Henry says I am, but some people like me
anyhow."</p>

<p>Jack leaned over and took Frieda's chin in
one of her firm white hands.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span></p>

<p>"There isn't anybody else, is there little,
sister?" she demanded.</p>

<p>Returning her gaze straightforwardly,
Frieda answered severely.</p>

<p>"Certainly not, Jack; what do you think
of me? Don't you know I am married. I
told you I didn't like men any more, and
never intend to have anything to do with
them again."</p>

<p>"Then I'll leave you now, dear, and send
one of the maids to help you dress, if you
like," Jack answered. "Let's don't talk any
more today on this subject and please don't
worry. You have lost all your color shut up
by yourself in that wretched New York
hotel. Hurry and come out in the garden
with Olive and the babies and me."</p>

<p>But when Jack had left her sister, she did
not dismiss the thought of their conversation
so lightly as her words implied. Perhaps
Frieda had not made out a very good case for
herself against her husband. It looked as if
Professor Russell must have a story to tell
as well. But the main fact appeared that
Frieda was not happy in her marriage. Whatever
the reasons, or whoever was at fault, it
was the <i>thing</i> itself which worried Jack. It
was plain enough that Professor Russell was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
too old for Frieda, and that his scholarly
tastes were not suited to her girlish ones.</p>

<p>"A Professor of Dead Languages married
to Frieda!" Jack whispered, blaming herself
once again for allowing the marriage. Well,
nothing could be decided for the present at
any rate. One must wait for at least a little
more light!</p>

<p>Out in the garden Jack and Olive and
Frieda played all morning with Jack's two
babies. Jimmie was a little fair haired, blue
eyed, rose cheeked English boy. Vive was a
different kind of baby; she had light yellow
hair, and dark eyes unlike either Jack's or
Frank's. Perhaps she was going to resemble
the lovely old time portrait in the library.</p>

<p>Frieda spent several hours with Vive in her
arms, although she never had been particularly
interested in any baby before.</p>

<p>When lunch was over, Jack said unexpectedly:</p>

<p>"I hope you'll forgive me, Frieda, if I leave
you and Olive for a little while. I promised
a friend, Captain MacDonnell, to ride with
him this afternoon before I dreamed you
were coming, and I have forgotten to let him
know. Besides," Jack added, since never
even in small matters could she be dishonest,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
"I really want the ride. Captain MacDonnell
is the one person who likes to ride as hard as
I do. Oh, of course, English women ride
marvelously well&mdash;far better than I, and
there is nothing they won't attempt in hunting.
But what I like now and then is just a
straight cross country ride&mdash;as near like the
old rides across the prairies as I can manage,
though I must say this country does not look
much like the prairies," Jack ended, as she
glanced smiling out the window at her own
beautiful, well kept English lawn. "Wait,
Frieda, and meet Bryan won't you? he is one
of Frank's and my dearest friends."</p>

<p>So Olive and Frieda were standing together
on the veranda at the side of Kent House
when Jack and Captain MacDonnell finally
rode off, accompanied by a groom.</p>

<p>"I declare Jack looks better on horseback
than any one in the world," Frieda announced
admiringly. "Her costume is more stylish
than the old khaki or corduroy things she
used to wear at the ranch, but I don't think
Jack herself is very much changed, except
that she is more attractive."</p>

<p>At this instant Jack turned to wave her
riding whip back at her sister and friend.
She had on a perfect fitting tan cloth habit<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
with a long English coat and short trousers
and high riding boots. Her yellow brown
hair was braided low on her neck and she
wore a small derby.</p>

<p>"Captain MacDonnell is handsome too,
isn't he?" Frieda remarked reflectively, before
moving to go indoors. "I wonder if he and
Jack are very intimate and if Frank minds
her riding with him like this? I suppose not,
or Jack wouldn't," she acknowledged.</p>

<p>Then she turned to Olive. "Don't look so
cross, for goodness sake, Olive. I am not
criticizing Jack. I don't suppose you imagine
she is any more perfect than I do, only I was
just thinking how you and the entire family
will probably blame me for doing pretty much
the same kind of thing that Jack is doing.
Of course, I don't think there is anything
wrong in it. It is absurd and horrid of people
to believe there is."</p>

<p>Olive was about to reply, but before she
could speak, Frieda interrupted her.</p>

<p>"Oh, I know exactly what you are going
to say, Olive. Jack and I are very different
persons! I know that as well as you do. I
know, too, that Jack would never do anything
except what was right. She could not if she
tried. But she might do something silly.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
I don't suppose there is any human being in
the world who fails to be foolish at one time
or other in this life," Frieda concluded.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>A LATE ARRIVAL<br /><br /><br /></div>


<div class='cap'>FRANK KENT returned unexpectedly
from London early in the same afternoon.
He had not yet heard of Frieda's
arrival, so that they at once spent an hour
talking together.</div>

<p>Lord Kent, as most men did, treated his
sister-in-law as a very pretty and charming
young woman, who was not to be taken
seriously. His wife had told him of Frieda's
difficulty with her husband, but not of the
cause. At that time she was not aware of it.
Also she had instructed him not to mention
the prospect of Professor Russell's appearance
in England. So Frieda and Frank chatted
and teased each other, as they had since she
was a little girl just entering her teens, but
neither referred to any unpleasant subject.</p>

<p>Lord Kent had seemed tired when he first
came home and was disappointed to find his
wife absent.</p>

<p>After his conversation with Frieda he
relaxed and appeared more cheerful and good<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
natured. This was the effect Frieda usually
had upon masculine persons. She was so
gentle and pretty, and her eyes were such a
clear blue that one felt she could be easily
influenced or persuaded. But the truth was
that Frieda was no more easily controlled than
a kitten. If ever one tries to train a little
domestic animal, it will be discovered that a
dog is far more quickly influenced than a
kitten. As a matter of fact a kitten is probably
the most <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'unchangable'">unchangeable</ins> of all domestic
pets.</p>

<p>Since the early afternoon the July day had
altered. A soft rain had begun falling, so
that tea at Kent House was served in the
library.</p>

<p>Olive, Frieda and Lord Kent waited half
an hour later than usual, thinking that Jack
and Captain MacDonnell would return.
Then they drank their tea slowly, still believing
that the riders would surely appear before
they had finished.</p>

<p>At half past five, when there was still no
sign of his wife and friend, Lord Kent got
up and several times walked back and forth
from his chair to the big French window.</p>

<p>For the moment Frieda had gone out of the
room, so that he finally spoke to Olive.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span></p>

<p>"I suppose it is ridiculous of me, but I am
always more or less uneasy when Jack and
Bryan go off for rides together. Jack is the
most fearless horsewoman in the world and
Bryan the most all round, fearless man. He
has killed big game in Africa and India and
Australia, traveled in the Congo and in other
equally uncivilized places. He never used to
stay for any length of time in England. Now
and then I have an idea of forbidding Jack
to ride with him, I am so uncertain of what
reckless thing they may do together."</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't think you need worry, Frank,"
Olive returned, "Jack is fearless but I don't
think she has been reckless since the accident
she had when a girl."</p>

<p>Although she could scarcely speak of it,
Olive was smiling to herself over Frank's use
of the word "forbid." She never recalled
that any one had ever forbidden Jack to do
anything she wished so long as she had
known her. But probably Frank's forbidding
was of the gentlest kind. Olive felt she must
remember that the English attitude toward
marriage was not the same as the American,
although when an Englishman marries an
American girl they are supposed to strike the
happy medium.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span></p>

<p>Entering the room again just as Frank concluded
his speech, Frieda was even more
startled when she recalled that the use of this
very word had been one of the reasons for the
most serious quarrel she had ever had with
her husband. Henry had never used the
word a second time.</p>

<p>Another hour passed. Still Jack and
Captain MacDonnell had not returned.
Moreover, by this time the rain had become
a steady downpour. Olive and Frieda were
also uneasy.</p>

<p>"If you will forgive my leaving you, I
believe I will go and see if I can find what
has become of the wanderers," Frank suggested.
Then, without further explanation
or discussion, he went away.</p>

<p>Ten minutes later, mounted on his own
horse, he was riding down the rain-washed
road. He had found that the groom, who
had accompanied Jack and Captain MacDonnell,
had gotten separated from them and
returned home half an hour before.</p>

<p>Frank was uncertain whether he were the
more angry or uneasy. It seemed impossible
to imagine what misfortune could have
befallen his wife and friend, which would
have made it impossible for them to have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
either telephoned or sent some message home.
Yet it was equally impossible to conceive
that Jack would be so careless as to forget
every one else in the pursuit of her own
pleasure. Even if she had been uncertain of
his arrival from London, there was Olive,
who had been her guest only a few days
and Frieda not twenty-four hours. But as
a matter of fact Jack had known he would
be down sometime during the evening
although she did not know the hour.</p>

<p>July is one of the long twilight months
in England. Nevertheless, because of the
rain, the evening was a kind of smoke grey
with the faintest lavender tones in the sky.
A heavy mist was also rising from the ground,
so that with the falling rain one could not
see many yards ahead.</p>

<p>Lord Kent's plan was to leave word with his
lodgekeeper at the lodge gate to follow after
him in case any word came from Lady Kent,
or if she returned home before he did. But a
moment or so before reaching the lodge, while
yet in his own avenue, although at some
distance from Kent House, Frank heard
laughter and low voices. There was no
doubting the laughter was Jack's.</p>

<p>Frank pulled up his horse abruptly and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
stood still. The oncoming figures were walking
and leading their horses instead of riding.
That instant, because he was no longer uneasy,
Frank discovered that he was angrier and
more hurt than he cared to show.</p>

<p>All at once he overheard Jack say:</p>

<p>"Do hurry, please, Bryan; I'm afraid
everybody at home may be uneasy."</p>

<p>But instead of hurrying, they must have
stopped again. For the second time Jack
murmured, "I don't see how I could ever
have been such a wretch, or how I'll ever
confess to Frank."</p>

<p>Then Captain MacDonnell's inquiry:</p>

<p>"What are you going to say?"</p>

<p>And his wife's answer:</p>

<p>"Why, tell the truth and face the music;
what else is there to do, Bryan?"</p>

<p>In the past few years since his marriage,
undoubtedly Frank Kent had either altered
or simply developed. Sometimes it is difficult
to determine which one of these two things
a human being has done. Frank had always
been quiet and determined. If he had been
otherwise he would never have tried for so
many years to persuade Jacqueline Ralston
to marry him. But now that he had grown
older, he certainly appeared sterner. He<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
seemed to have certain fixed ideas of right
and wrong, and they were not broad ideas,
to which he expected at least the members of
his own household to conform.</p>

<p>The two wayfarers were now in sight and
Frank dismounted.</p>

<p>"I am sorry to have been compelled to
play eavesdropper," he said curtly, when
they also caught sight of him.</p>

<p>Jack was soaked with rain and her boots
and riding habit were splashed with mud. A
little river of water filled and overflowed the
brim of her hat. But her cheeks were a deep
rose color and her grey eyes dear and shining.</p>

<p>Frank would never have confessed that he
felt a slight pang of jealousy at the good time
his wife and friend must have been having,
while he had been making himself miserable
with the thought that a disaster had befallen
them.</p>

<p>Jack's hand was resting on the nose of her
horse, while Captain MacDonnell held the
bridles of both.</p>

<p>"You have come out to search for us,
haven't you, Frank?" Jack began penitently.
"I am sorry; I did not know you could have
arrived from London so soon." She was
now close beside her husband. "The truth<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
is, Frank, I have had rather a horrid tumble.
For a person who thinks she knows how to
ride, I seem to do the stupidest possible
things."</p>

<p>"You don't seem to have hurt yourself
seriously, Jack," Frank answered grimly.
For in spite of her penitence, which did not
seem very profound, Jack looked extraordinarily
happy and glowing.</p>

<p>"No, I wasn't hurt in the least. I managed
to get clear as we went down. But my horse's
knee was sprained&mdash;not so badly as Bryan
and I at first thought. Still I did not like
to ride him, so we have been walking along
through the rain for a few miles."</p>

<p>"How did the accident occur? I am rather
surprised, Jack," Frank answered, now plainly
more sympathetic because a little uneasy at
what could have happened to his wife.</p>

<p>Jack turned aside and even in the dusk one
could see she was embarrassed.</p>

<p>"Oh, I was disobeying orders," she said
with a pretence of lightness. "I went over
a rather high fence, which I had never taken
before, without waiting until Bryan could
get up to me. I made the jump without
trouble, but the ground on the other side was
so soft that my horse's forefeet went down<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
into it. He stumbled and fell. That is why
I am such a spectacle," she concluded, touching
her mud-stained habit with her whip.</p>

<p>Whatever he may have felt, Frank would
naturally not discuss a difference between
himself and his wife before another person.
He therefore made no comment, but instead
suggested:</p>

<p>"Suppose you get on my horse, Jack, and
ride up to the house. Frieda and Olive are
uneasy. Bryan and I will come along
together."</p>

<p>According to the English custom, Lord
and Lady Kent occupied separate bedrooms,
which opened into each other.</p>

<p>A half hour later Jack was dressing for
dinner when she heard Frank enter his room.
But he did not come into her apartment or
call out to her, although they were usually
in the habit of discussing various questions
through their open door, while they changed
their clothes.</p>

<p>Jack, of course, recognized that her husband
was angry with her. Also she knew that he
had a measure of right on his side. She had
promised him not to attempt dangerous
jumping in her cross-country riding. Her
accident a number of years before had made<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
him and all the members of her family more
nervous about her than they would ordinarily
have been, knowing that she had spent a large
part of her life on horseback. Moreover,
Frank had very rigid ideas about keeping
one's word, not agreeing that one could
swerve by a hair's breadth.</p>

<p>In a good deal of haste, since dinner was
to be announced at any moment, Jack put
on a white satin dinner dress. It was an old
one, but chanced to be particularly becoming.
The gown was simply made, with a square
neck and a fold of tulle about the throat and a
long, severely plain skirt. Only a woman
with a figure as perfect as Jack's could have
looked well in it. Her hair was arranged
with equal simplicity, being coiled closely
about her head and held in place with a
carved ivory comb.</p>

<p>Half a dozen guests had been invited to
dinner, nevertheless before going downstairs
Jack went first into her husband's room.</p>

<p>Jack had always had a lovely nature. In
the old days at Rainbow Lodge in any difficulty
with one of the Ranch girls, although
having a high temper, she had been quick
to confess herself in the wrong. Since her
marriage she had been more than ever inclined<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
to do likewise with her husband. So it was but
natural that Frank should be under the
impression that she would at all times eventually
come around to his point of view. He
did not realize that under some circumstances
Jack might be as inflexible as he was.</p>

<p>However, she waited a moment now with
perfect good temper, while Frank pretended
that he had not heard her enter his room.
When he finally did look toward her, she went
up to him and put her arms about him.
Then, as he continued to frown, Jack smiled.
She knew that her husband took small matters
too seriously, having made this discovery
soon after her marriage, just as all girls make
similar discoveries. But Jack was wise
enough to realize that she must try as wisely
as she could to discount this uncomfortable
characteristic.</p>

<p>"Don't be grouchy, please, Frank," she
murmured. "I told you I was sorry, and you
know that every now and then I have to get
rid of some of my surplus American energy.
After a hard ride with Bryan I can be a conventional
English Lady for weeks."</p>

<p>In spite of her good intention, Jack's
remark was not wise. No matter how
devoted a man and woman may be to each<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
other, there is obliged to be some difference
of opinion in every international marriage.</p>

<p>Frank was extremely sensitive over the
idea that Jack was not as happy in the English
life he offered her, as she had been in the old
days on her own ranch.</p>

<p>"That is unfortunate, Jack," he returned,
"for I have made up my mind that it will be
wiser for you not to ride with Bryan again.
I am afraid you are both too fond of adventure
to be trusted."</p>

<p>Then, as Frank had delivered his edict, his
own good temper was restored. As he was
already dressed, putting his arm across Jack's
shoulder, he started for the door. He was
really immensely proud of Jack and thought
she looked unusually lovely tonight. In spite
of the number of years he had been married he
never introduced her to his friends, or saw
her at the head of his table, without a feeling
of pride. Also, Frank counted on Jack's
sweetness of temper. It did not occur to
him that she would disagree with his request,
or rather with his command, since without
intending it, he had expressed his wish in
such a fashion.</p>

<p>Nevertheless Jack hesitated. She knew
that Frank was not in an agreeable mood<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
for a discussion then. Also, that they could
not keep their guests waiting while one took
place.</p>

<p>"I think that is rather arbitrary of you,
Frank, since neither Bryan nor I are children
and he is one of the friends I most enjoy.
But perhaps we had better talk of this at
another time."</p>

<p>Frank nodded, Jack's manner affording no
idea that she would not ultimately give in
to him, nor was she sure herself. It may be
that Jack had become too much of a domestic
pacifist&mdash;a woman who wishes for peace at
any price.</p>

<p>On the landing of the steps, just before they
went down to dinner, Frank remarked hastily:</p>

<p>"Oh Jack, I had a marconigram from
Professor Russell. He must have heard of
Frieda's sudden departure from New York.
In any case his ship is due tomorrow, for he
left the day after she sailed."</p>

<p>"Gracious, have you told Frieda?" Jack
returned nervously, forgetting for the instant
her own <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'personall'">personal</ins> quandary. "Frieda
announced that she never would agree to see
Professor Russell again. In any case I had
hoped we might have a few weeks of grace,
to allow things to quiet down or perhaps to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
persuade Frieda to change her mind. The
only thing now is not to allow Professor Russell
to come to Kent House until Frieda gives
her consent."</p>

<p>"Nonsense, Jack," Frank answered reassuringly,
"Frieda cannot behave in any such
fashion. You have not told me the trouble,
but I suspect that Frieda has simply been a
spoiled child. Besides, in any case, she has
no right to refuse at least to see her husband
and talk the situation over. Don't worry;
I'll discuss the matter with Frieda myself
in the morning and bring her around. You
see, I telegraphed Russell at the dock to come
directly to us, as I shall spend tomorrow at
home."</p>

<p>"All right," Jack conceded, a good deal
worried, but also slightly amused. If her
husband wished to undertake to persuade
Frieda to change her mind, she was glad that
the task was his and not hers. Of course
Frank thought it would be a simple matter,
since he had yet really to know his sister-in-law.
It was only natural that he should
suppose Frieda would be easier to guide
than his wife, judging by Frieda's manner
and appearance! Men are not always wise
in their judgment of feminine character.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>AN APPARITION<br /><br /><br /></div>


<div class='cap'>THE next morning Frieda received a
message from her brother-in-law
asking her to give him half an hour
of her time, whenever it was convenient to
her.</div>

<p>In a way she had anticipated this request,
although it had come sooner than she expected.
Frieda knew that Frank was fond of her and
regarded himself as her brother. She had
no other. Also, she held a wise idea inside her
blonde head, believing that men were apt to
stand together in many difficulties of the
kind in which she and her husband were now
involved.</p>

<p>However, Frieda did not, of course, anticipate
the news of her husband's having immediately
followed her to Europe. She had not written
to him or to any friend in Chicago since her
sudden departure. But she had made up her
mind that the last interview between herself
and Henry was their final one. There could
be no reason for their ever meeting again.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
She supposed, of course, that there were
certain matters that would have to be arranged
in the future, but Frieda was not given to
troubling herself over details. Someone
else had always attended to such things for
her, in order that she might have her way.
Later, Jim Colter, or Frank, or a lawyer&mdash;Frieda
was entirely vague as to the method
to be employed&mdash;would have to see that she
was released from the cause of her unhappiness.</p>

<p>For since arriving at Jack's house not thirty-six
hours before, Frieda had been happier than
she had for several months. Therefore,
during the night she had decided for the
<ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'hundreth'">hundredth</ins> time, that her husband must be the
sole cause of all the upsetting emotions which
had been recently troubling her. So soon as
she could learn to forget Henry and put the
recollection of him entirely out of her mind,
she would again become the perfectly care
free and irresponsible Frieda of the old days at
the Rainbow Ranch.</p>

<p>As she was not fond of getting up in the
mornings and usually did pretty much what
she liked in her sister's house, Frieda had
not gone down to breakfast. However, she
sent word to her brother-in-law that she<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
would be glad to see him in her own sitting
room between eleven and twelve o'clock.</p>

<p>Whether it was done intentionally or not,
Frieda put on a frock in which she looked
particularly young. It was a simple white
muslin, with sprays of blue flowers and folded
kerchief fashion across Frieda's white throat.
Nothing could really make Frieda appear
demure; her lips were too full and crimson;
her nose was too retrous&eacute;e and her hair held
too much pure sunlight. But she could look
very innocent and much abused, and this was
the impression she subconsciously wished to
make. One must not believe that Frieda
actually thought out matters of this kind, but
she was one of the women who acted on what
is supposed to be feminine instinct.</p>

<p>Frank thought Frieda looked about sixteen
instead of twenty-two when he arrived to talk
matters over with her. So at once it struck
him as absurd that he was forced to discuss
so serious a question as leaving her husband
with a mere child like Frieda. Instead of
argument Frank began with persuasion.
First he invited Frieda to tell her side of the
story, which he had heard in part from Jack.
Although he had said at the time of his wife's
confidence, that Frieda had not made much<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
of a case for herself, on hearing her story from
Frieda's own lips he offered no such criticism.</p>

<p>When Frieda ended she was crying, so that
Frank sympathetically took her hand to console
her as any other man would. Then, while
holding her hand, he attempted a mild argument
in favor of the Professor, finally concluding:</p>

<p>"Frieda, your husband is coming to Kent
House some time this afternoon. Since it is
really your duty to see him and talk over the
misunderstanding between you, I feel sure
you will."</p>

<p>Nevertheless, Frieda gently but obstinately
shook her head.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry to disappoint you, Frank, and
Jack too, if she really feels as you do, but I
never mean to see Henry again."</p>

<p>However, until lunch time Frank remained
in the blue sitting room discussing the foolishness
of her position with Frieda; afterwards
he felt that he had never presented any
subject so skillfully in his career as a member
of Parliament, as he argued her own case with
his sister-in-law. Frieda never questioned
him, never contradicted him, only she continued
to shake her head and to repeat
gently, "I'm sorry, Frank, but I can't."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span></p>

<p>Several times Lord Kent attempted severity
because his severity usually influenced most
people. It influenced Frieda, but only to
such an outburst of tears, that he was forced
to spend the next five minutes in apologizing
in order to comfort her.</p>

<p>At one o'clock Jack, appearing at the door,
immediately recognized the situation. Both
Frank and Frieda appeared exhausted.
Frieda announced that she would not come to
lunch, but would prefer to lie down all the
afternoon. As a matter of fact the possibility
that her husband might make his appearance
at Kent House was the real reason which
kept Frieda in her own room, although offering
the excuse of a headache.</p>

<p>Therefore, about four o'clock, when Professor
Henry Tilford Russell finally did
arrive, he was able to see only Lord and Lady
Kent, his brother-in-law and sister-in-law.</p>

<p>Personally, Jack was uncertain how she
should greet him. Of what actual unkindness
he was guilty of to Frieda she was not yet
certain. Nevertheless, the fact remaining
that he had not made her little sister happy
filled Lady Kent with resentment and dislike.
Certainly, Professor Russell should have
realized how much older he was than<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
Frieda and not expected her to conform to his
dullness and routine.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact Jack also would have
preferred not to have to come in contact with
her sister's husband until she understood
the situation between them more thoroughly.
Yet, when Professor Russell was announced,
it was she who was forced to go first into the
drawing room.</p>

<p>There must have been a delay of about five
minutes since she had waited that length of
time for her husband, who chanced to have
gone out to the stables to give an order.
Then, fearing to appear intentionally rude,
Jack approached their visitor alone.</p>

<p>He could not have heard her as she entered,
for he was sitting in a large chair with his
head resting in his hand and looked so
exhausted, possibly from his trip, that Lady
Kent forgot for the moment to be angry.
When he aroused himself and later held out
his hand, she took it at once, although a
moment before she had not been sure whether
she ought, because of her own loyalty to
Frieda.</p>

<p>"Is Frieda well? If you only realized the
relief to find she is safe here with you! At
first I did not know where the child had gone,"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
Professor Russell began so simply, that any
human being would have been disarmed.</p>

<p>It will be remembered, that in the last
volume of the "Ranch Girls At Home Again,"
Professor Russell is introduced to the Ranch
girls by Ralph Merritt, who told them of the
Professor's intense dislike for girls. At first
he appeared to regard Frieda only as a child
and therefore made an exception of her.
Then, later, after his accident at Rainbow
Mine when his leg was broken and Frieda
undertook to keep him amused, an amazing
friendship developed between them which
finally resulted in their marriage.</p>

<p>In replying to his question Jack found
herself answering as reassuringly as if Frieda
really had been a runaway child, since this
seemed to be the spirit in which her husband
thought of her.</p>

<p>"She will see me?" he asked eagerly. But
when Jack shook her head he did not appear
surprised, being evidently accustomed to
Frieda's vagaries.</p>

<p>Moreover, Lord Kent then came into the
room.</p>

<p>Afterwards, Professor Russell related his
side of the difficulty between himself and his
wife. His story did not after all differ so<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
much from Frieda's account, for he put the
blame upon himself, as she had done.</p>

<p>"I was too old for her; we ought never to
have married. The fault was all mine," he
ended so despondently, that Jack felt as if she
could not accept the very conclusion she had
reached the day before.</p>

<p>Professor Russell could not be persuaded
to remain long&mdash;not even for tea. It was
agreed, however, that he would spend the
next few weeks in London and that later they
might reach some decision. In the meantime
Jack promised to do her best to persuade her
sister to have at least one interview with her
husband.</p>

<p>Lord Kent followed his brother-in-law to
the door.</p>

<p>"Frieda is a spoiled baby; you have simply
been too good to her. Some day she will
wake up and find this out for herself," he
declared.</p>

<p>But Professor Russell only shook his head
sadly and departed.</p>

<p>Even after learning of her husband's
departure Frieda still refused to join her
family. What she was thinking about alone
in her own apartment no one knew, since she
asked that no one disturb her.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span></p>

<p>However, at half past five, realizing that
her husband then must be safely on his way
back to London, Frieda decided that she
could endure her own rooms no longer.
Without a word to anyone, she put on a long,
light weight blue coat and a small, close
fitting, blue turban and passing down
through the long halls and through a side
entrance vanished into the outdoors.</p>

<p>It was Frieda's plan merely to walk about
in the gardens until she could persuade herself
into a calmer frame of mind. She was sure,
of course, that she cared nothing for her
husband and yet all afternoon she had found
herself wondering if he were not worn out by
his journey. Ordinarily he was not a good
traveler and he must also have suffered
through being compelled to desert his summer
classes at the University in order to seek her.</p>

<p>Frieda discovered one of the gardeners at
work in the flower beds and, as he persisted
in talking with her, she started down one of
the shaded avenues along the edge of the park
in order to be alone. She did not often walk
for any distance, since she had never been
so fond of exercise as the other girls.</p>

<p>But Frieda felt unexplainably restless and
out of sorts. This was foolish because, having<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
made up her mind that she wanted her freedom
and being determined to gain it, there
was no point in worrying.</p>

<p>Frieda kept walking hurriedly on. It was
a beautiful, soft afternoon, with the first hint
of twilight in the sky and in the atmosphere.</p>

<p>Kent Park covered several acres and Frieda
wandered further from the house than she
knew. After a time the road which she had
taken curved into a path leading into the
woods. There was a fairly heavy forest
near by, which was a part of the Kent estate
and she strolled into this.</p>

<p>Later, Frieda sat down for a few minutes.
She was in no hurry to return home, except
in time for dinner which was at a late hour,
according to the English custom. Not that
she meant to appear at dinner, but that Jack
or Olive would be sure to seek her at that
time.</p>

<p>Frieda made rather a charming picture
amid the scene she had unconsciously chosen
for herself. She was sitting on the trunk of a
tree which had fallen from the weight of
years and infirmities. There was a little
clearing behind her and, as she had taken off
her hat, the sun shone on her bowed head
and shoulders. She wished very much that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
she could stop thinking about a number of
things, for Frieda was one of the people who
resent having to grow up and there are more
of them in this world than we realize.</p>

<p>Then, suddenly, Frieda heard an odd noise,
which at least startled her sufficiently to
bring the result she had been wishing for,
since it made her stop thinking of unpleasant
things. The noise was not loud
and it would have been difficult to have
explained exactly what the sound was. Only
Frieda for the first time realized that she had
been unwise in having come so far away from
the house without mentioning to anyone
where she was going.</p>

<p>The woods in which she was resting was a
portion of the game preserves belonging to the
Kent Estate, or a portion of land set apart
for hunting at certain times of the year on
English estates. But no one is supposed to
hunt on this land except the owner of the
estate and the friends whom he may care to
invite.</p>

<p>Frieda, of course, had stayed long enough
in England on other visits to understand that
poachers are more or less frequent. She
thought perhaps the noise she had heard
was a man in hiding, who had been hunting<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
and feared she might report him. The fact
that it was summer time, when hunting was
infrequent, made no impression upon her.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 316px;">
<img src="images/illus02.jpg" width="316" height="500" alt="In a Few Moments She was in a Panic" title="" />
<span class="caption">In a Few Moments She was in a Panic</span>
</div>

<p>At first, however, she was not seriously
frightened, although she concluded to hurry
back to Kent House as quickly as possible.</p>

<p>But when she started back through the
woods, whoever it was in hiding evidently attempted
to follow her. The faster she walked,
the faster the footsteps came on behind.</p>

<p>However, Frieda did not turn her head to
discover her pursuer. She had been nervous
and worried all day, or she might not have
become so alarmed. Instead of looking back
she continued hurrying on faster and faster
until, in a few moments, she was in a panic.
Then she started to run and to her horror
realized that a man was also running with
long, easy strides behind her.</p>

<p>Frieda was totally unaccustomed to looking
after herself in any emergency, and had never
been compelled to do so&mdash;even in small
adversities. Now she had a sudden impulse
to call out for someone, but had only sufficient
breath to increase her speed. If she
could get a little nearer the house, one of the
servants could be sure to come to her
assistance.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span></p>

<p>But Frieda had run only a few yards when,
as a perfectly natural result of her panic, she
tripped over some roots hidden in the underbrush
and fell forward with her face amid the
leaves and twigs and with one leg crumpled
under her.</p>

<p>She must have struck her chin for she felt
a dull pain and a queer numbness in her side.
However, when she tried to disentangle herself
and jump up quickly the pain became more
acute. Nevertheless, for one instant Frieda
struggled and then lay still, for her pursuer
had already reached her and was bending
over her, for what purpose Frieda did not
know.</p>

<p>Then she heard a slow, inexpressibly familiar
voice say:</p>

<p>"I am afraid I have frightened you, my
dear. I do trust you have not injured yourself."
Then a pair of strong, gentle hands
attempted to lift her.</p>

<p>Naturally, Frieda's first sensation was one
of amazement; the second, relief; and the
third, anger.</p>

<p>She managed, however, with assistance to
sit in an upright position. Then she began
brushing off the twigs and dirt which she felt
had been ground into her face. Finally she<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
recovered sufficient breath and self control
to be able to speak.</p>

<p>"Henry Russell!" she exclaimed, trying
to reveal both dignity and disdain, in spite
of her ridiculous position, "will you please
tell me why you are hiding in Frank's woods
like a thief, and why, when I refused to see
you, you terrified the life out of me by chasing
me until I nearly killed myself. I think, at
least, I have broken my leg," she ended
petulantly.</p>

<p>Professor Henry Tilford Russell flushed
all over his fair, scholarly face. Taking off
his soft grey hat, he ran his hand over the
top of his head, where the hair was already
beginning to grow thin.</p>

<p>"My dear Frieda, you do me an injustice,"
he began, "although I know my actions do
appear as you have just stated them. The
truth is I found myself unable to go away at
once from Kent House. I am not fond of London.
I dreaded the loneliness there; also I
longed for a sight of you to know for myself
that you were well. So I wandered about
through the grounds at some distance from
the house and finally entered these woods.
When you came into them alone and so
unexpectedly, it seemed as if I must speak to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
you. I started toward you and you ran. I
did not think my pursuit would alarm you.
It was one of the many things, Frieda, I
should have understood and did not."</p>

<p>In spite of the fact that the fault of the
present situation was undoubtedly Professor
Russell's, there was an unconscious dignity
and <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'graciousnesss'">graciousness</ins> about him as he made his
apology, which Frieda recognized was
undoubtedly lacking both in her appearance
and emotions. She felt extremely cross and
her leg hurt. She could not go up to the
house assisted by a husband whom she had
just scornfully refused to see, and yet she
did not believe she could walk alone.</p>

<p>"Very well, Henry; now that you have
accomplished your purpose, I hope you will
be good enough to leave me," Frieda
demanded, believing that she would rather
suffer anything than a continuance of her
present humiliation.</p>

<p>But Professor Russell did not stir.</p>

<p>"I prefer to see you safely through the
woods. When we are nearer the house I may
be able to find someone to take my place."</p>

<p>Professor Russell then leaned over and
lifted Frieda to her feet. As a result she
found that her leg was not broken or sprained,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
but only bruised, and that walking was
possible if she moved slowly.</p>

<p>However, Frieda suffered considerable pain
and she was not accustomed to bodily discomfort.
At first she tried not to rest her
weight upon the Professor's arm, for he had
put his arm under hers and was attempting
to support her almost entirely. But, by and
by, as the pain grew worse, she found herself
growing more dependent and, as a matter of
fact, her dependence seemed perfectly natural.
Once it occurred to her that, during her first
acquaintance with Professor Russell, he had
been hurt and in more ways than one had
leaned upon her. No one ever had asked any
kind of care from her before, and in those
days she had at least thought that she had
fallen in love with the Professor. At least
she had insisted upon marrying him, when
her entire family had opposed the union.</p>

<p>There was no conversation between the
husband and wife, except that several times
Professor Russell, without waiting to be asked,
stopped for Frieda to rest.</p>

<p>Then, by and by, when they had reached
the edge of the woods, he saw one of the men
servants at a little distance off and signalled
to him.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span></p>

<p>"There are many things I would like to
talk over with you, Frieda, but this is not the
time. Neither do I want you to think I
meant to take an unfair advantage of you by
forcing myself upon you without your knowledge.
I think I scarcely realized myself just
what I was doing. I am sorry you felt compelled
to run away from home because we
sometimes quarreled. I do not know just
how much I was in the wrong at those times,
but I fear you were not happy with me or
you would not have let the fact that we
differed about a good many things have made
you wish to leave me. Please remember,
Frieda, if there is ever a time when you wish
to talk matters over with me, I shall be glad
to come to you. I will not come again unless
you summon me."</p>

<p>Then, as the man servant had by this time
reached them, Professor Russell gave Frieda
into the man's charge.</p>

<p>The next instant, bowing to her as if he
had been a stranger, he turned and started
in the opposite direction.</p>

<p>Frieda did not remember whether she even
said good-bye. She did think, however, that
she would have liked to have reminded Henry
to hold his shoulders straighter. Really he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
was not so old&mdash;only something over thirty.
He seemed to have been one of the persons
born old, caring always more for books than
people&mdash;more for study than an active life.
Frieda actually felt a little sorry for him.
Always she must have been a disturbing
influence in his life. Perhaps in his way he
had been good to her, or at least had intended
to be. She wished that she had told him to
go back home because she could write to him
there, or in case she ever wished to see him,
she could also go home. She intended to go
to the Rainbow ranch in the autumn.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>THE CLOUD<br /><br /><br /></div>


<div class='cap'>THE next weeks in July were extraordinarily
beautiful ones in England.
The summer was warmer than usual
and the sun shone with greater radiance.
The English country was hauntingly lovely
and serene.</div>

<p>In spite of Frieda's trouble, the three
Ranch girls enjoyed one another, as they
had had no opportunity of doing since Jack's
marriage and coming abroad to live.</p>

<p>There were long walks and rides and
exchanges of visits with their country neighbors.
Now and then Lady Kent and Olive
went up to London for a few days of the
theatre and the last part of the social season.
They were Lord Kent's guests in the Ladies'
Gallery in the House of Parliament and drank
tea on the wonderful old balcony that overlooks
the Thames river. But Frieda preferred
not to accompany them.</p>

<p>London was never more filled with tourists,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
the greater number Americans intending to
leave later for the continent.</p>

<p>But so far as Professor Russell was concerned,
no word had been heard from him
since his unceremonious meeting with his
wife. However, he had sent his banker's
address to Lord Kent, saying that all mail
would be forwarded to him from there. Then
he appeared to have dropped completely out of
sight for, in spite of his brother-in-law's
effort toward friendliness, he had not called
upon him a second time.</p>

<p>In discussing the matter between themselves,
Jack and Frank decided that this was
possibly the best arrangement for the present.
Frieda had never mentioned her unexpected
discovery of her husband; nor did she ever
voluntarily refer to her married life. Therefore,
whatever was going on inside her mind,
no one had any knowledge of it. As is often
the case with women and girls of Frieda's
temperament, she was better able to keep her
own counsel than the women who are supposed
to be strong minded and who are more apt to
be frank.</p>

<p>So far as Jack was concerned she had never
reopened with Frank the question of her rides
with Captain MacDonnell, because the latter<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
had been away and he had not asked her to
ride since his return.</p>

<p>However, neither of these facts were so
important as the feeling Jack had, that no
propitious moment had arrived for a second
discussion of the subject with her husband.
She did not intend to defy him, but to make
him see that he had no right to be so arbitrary
and&mdash;more than that&mdash;so domineering. This
had been Jack's usual method in any difference
of opinion between herself and Frank, or
in any unlikeness between the American and
English point of view concerning marriage.
As a matter of fact, more than half the time
Jack had been successful.</p>

<p>But, during the past few weeks she had
seen that Frank was worried and unlike himself&mdash;that
his attention was engaged on
matters which were not personal. For if the
weather and the climate appeared serene in
these particular July weeks in England the
state of English politics was not. For the
country was being harassed by the questions
of Home Rule for Ireland and by the Militant
Suffrage movement.</p>

<p>The Suffrage question was one which Lord
and Lady Kent had agreed not to discuss with
each other. To Jack, who had been brought<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
up in Wyoming&mdash;the first of the Suffrage
states in the United States&mdash;and who had
seen the success of it there, the fact that the
English nation held the idea of women voting
in such abhorrence and with such narrow
mindedness, was more a matter of surprise
than anything else. The fact that her husband,
who had also lived for a short time in
Wyoming, should also oppose woman's
suffrage was beyond her comprehension, except
that Frank had the Englishman's love for the
established order and disliked any change.
Jack would not confess to herself that he also
had the Englishman's idea that a woman
should be subservient to her husband and
that he should be master of his own house.
To give women the freedom, which the ballot
would bring, might be to allow them an independence
in which the larger majority of the
men of the British Isles did not then believe.
Neither did they realize&mdash;nor did the suffragists
themselves&mdash;how near their women were
to being able to prove their fitness.</p>

<p>One Saturday afternoon at the close of
July, Captain MacDonnell invited Jack and
Olive and Frieda and a number of his other
neighbors and friends to tea at his place. He
had no near relatives, and when he was in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
Kent county lived alone, except for his housekeeper
and servants, in an odd little house,
perhaps a century old, which had been left
him by his guardian.</p>

<p>The girls drove over together in a pony
carriage, usually devoted to Jack's children.
But at the gate they gave it into the charge
of a boy in order that they might walk up to
the house, which was of a kind found only in
England.</p>

<p>The house was built of rough plaster which
the years had toned to a soft grey. Captain
MacDonnell had the good taste to allow the
roof with its deep overhanging eaves to remain
thatched as it had been in early days. The
building was small and one walked up to the
front door through two long rows of hollyhocks.
On either side of the hollyhock sentinels
the earth was a thick carpet of flowers,
and the little house seemed to rise out of its
own flower beds.</p>

<p>There were no steps leading to the front
door except a single one, so the visitor entered
directly into the hall which divided the downstairs.
On the left side was a long room with
a raftered ceiling and high narrow windows,
and on the right Captain MacDonnell's den&mdash;a
small room littered with a young soldier's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
belongings. Beyond were the dining room
and kitchen and upstairs four bedrooms.
As the house was so small Captain MacDonnell
had turned his great, old-fashioned barn into
extra quarters for guests. Between the
house and the flower beds and the barn was
an open space of green lawn with an occasional
tree, and beyond was a tennis court. The
place was tiny and simple compared to Kent
House and yet had great charm.</p>

<p>Jack and Olive and Frieda arrived before the
other guests. They soon discovered that Mrs.
Naxie&mdash;Captain MacDonnell's housekeeper&mdash;had
arranged to serve tea in his living room.</p>

<p>It was through Jack's suggestion that the
arrangement was altered.</p>

<p>"Please don't tell Mrs. Naxie, Bryan,
that I spoke of it," she volunteered as soon
as she beheld the preparations, "but don't
you think the summer in England too short
for people to spend an hour indoors when they
can avoid it?"</p>

<p>And Captain MacDonnell good naturedly
agreed.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, Jack always poured
tea for him when he had guests and she was
able to be present, so she felt sufficiently at
home to make her request.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span></p>

<p>Captain MacDonnell's mother was an
Irishwoman and his father a Scotchman. But
they had both died when he was a little boy
and he had spent the greater part of his
boyhood with an old bachelor friend of his
father's, who was his own guardian and had
lived in the very house of which he was now
the master.</p>

<p>As neighbors he and Frank Kent had
played together when they were small boys
and had later gone to the same public school.
Then Frank's illness sent him to the United
States, where he was introduced into the lives
of the Ranch girls, at about the same time his
friend Bryan MacDonnell entered Cambridge
and afterwards the army. But whenever he
and Frank were together the old intimacy had
continued, and Jack's coming had only seemed
to turn their friendship into a three-cornered
one.</p>

<p>"Frank told me to tell you that he was sorry
not to be able to come over with us this
afternoon, Bryan," Jack announced a few
moments later, when the four of them had
gone out to select a place where tea could be
served, "But for some reason or other he
telephoned that he could not come down from
London today. I don't know what is wrong<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
with Frank lately. He has never been so
absorbed in political matters. I am afraid
Frieda and Olive will think he neglects his
family disgracefully. Please tell them, Bryan,
that he is sometimes an attentive husband."</p>

<p>But as Captain MacDonnell did not answer
at once, Olive remarked in a more serious
tone than Lady Kent had used:</p>

<p>"I think I am rather glad Frank takes his
work as a member of Parliament as the most
important thing he has to do. After all,
helping to make the laws of one's country is
a pretty serious occupation. Which do you
think more serious&mdash;Captain MacDonnell,
being a soldier and fighting when it is necessary
to defend the laws, or making them in the
beginning?"</p>

<p>Captain MacDonnell smiled, but rather
seriously. It occurred to Jack, who knew
him so much better than the others, that
Bryan did seem uncommonly grave this
afternoon, in spite of his efforts to be an
agreeable host.</p>

<p>Then she took hold of Frieda's arm and
they wandered off a short distance, leaving
Olive and Captain MacDonnell to continue
their conversation alone.</p>

<p>"Do you know, Frieda," Jack whispered<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
when they were safe from being overheard,
"I would give a great deal if Bryan and Olive
would learn to care for each other. Ordinarily
I think it is horrid to be a matchmaker, but
Bryan and Olive are both so lovely and you
don't know what it would mean to me to have
Olive live near me. It is heavenly these days,
having you both here. You can't realize how
lonely I get for you and my own country
sometimes."</p>

<p>Frieda looked critically over at Captain
MacDonnell and Olive, who were standing
close beside each other talking earnestly. In
spite of Captain MacDonnell's ancestry his
coloring was almost as dark as Olive's.</p>

<p>Then Frieda turned her blue eyes on her
sister.</p>

<p>"Captain MacDonnell and Olive look too
much alike," she argued. "I prefer marriages
where the man and woman are contrasts."</p>

<p>Then, although Lady Kent made no answer,
she smiled to herself. If Frieda believed in
contrasts in marriage, surely she did not mean
merely in complexion and general appearance.
Important contrasts in human beings went
much deeper than appearances. Surely
Frieda's own marriage had offered a sufficient
contrast in years, taste, disposition and a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
dozen other things. However, instead of
securing happiness, it seemed to have had the
opposite result.</p>

<p>During the remainder of the afternoon Jack
thought nothing more about their early conversation,
as she devoted herself entirely to
Captain MacDonnell's other guests.</p>

<p>It was just a little after six o'clock, when
they were beginning to think of returning
home, that Lady Kent observed one of her
servants coming toward her across the lawn
carrying a telegram.</p>

<p>Never so long as she lived was Jack ever
to forget that moment and the scene about
her. There were about a dozen, beautifully
costumed persons present&mdash;the women in
silks and muslins, and the men in tennis
flannels and other sport costumes. They
were all talking in a light hearted fashion
about small matters.</p>

<p>Without any thought that it might be of
particular importance Jack opened her telegram
and before reading it apologized to the
persons nearest her. It happened that Captain
MacDonnell was not far away.</p>

<p>Yet she read her telegram&mdash;not once, but
several times&mdash;before it dawned upon her
what her husband's words meant. Even<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
then she did not really understand any more
than the millions of other women in the world,
who heard the same news and more within
the next few days. The sky overhead was
still blue; the earth was green and peaceful,
and her companions were unconscious of
tragedy.</p>

<p>Nevertheless Frank's telegram had stated
that the beginning of the war cloud had
appeared over Europe&mdash;the cloud which was
later to spread over so large a part of the
world.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>SO AS BY FIRE<br /><br /><br /></div>


<div class='cap'>"BUT Henry cannot go; it is absurd!
He never shot a gun in his life and
besides I&mdash;" Frieda hesitated; her
face flushing; yet she was trying to speak
calmly.</div>

<p>She and Olive and Jack and Frank Kent
were in the library at Kent House with Captain
MacDonnell talking one morning, several
weeks since the afternoon tea and during,
perhaps, the most momentous week in all
history.</p>

<p>"I think you must be mistaken about your
husband's being unable to shoot, Frieda,"
Lord Kent answered dryly. "As a matter of
fact I believe he is an expert; he told me
himself that he had taken prizes for marksmanship
when he was a boy, but had never
cared to use his skill for hunting. As for
your saying he can't go; well, the truth is,
Frieda, Professor Russell has already gone.
He came in to see me a few days ago to say<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
that he had volunteered and was about to be
sent somewhere in France."</p>

<p>Frank had not intended to be unkind. So
many things had happened and were happening
every crowded second of the time that he
was simply forgetting to think of the individual.
However, under the circumstances,
he did not suppose that Frieda would care
very much what became of her husband.</p>

<p>"You mean that Henry has joined the
army&mdash;that he has crossed over to France
without asking me how I would feel&mdash;without
even coming to say good-bye," Frieda returned
slowly. And suddenly even her brother-in-law
observed the change in her expression. It
was strange to see Frieda with her face paling;
her full, red lips closed tight and her blue
eyes dark and strained.</p>

<p>"But, my dear child, how could your husband
come to say good-bye to you when you
have been steadfastly refusing to see him for
weeks?" Frank continued, still a little impatient
over feminine unreasonableness. "He
told me to tell you his plans and that he had
made all arrangements in case&mdash;"</p>

<p>But, that instant, catching a warning
glance from his wife, Lord Kent changed
color over his own tactlessness and desisted.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
This was a time when everybody's nerves
were overstrained; when hearts were torn to
pieces and imaginations were picturing only
horrors.</p>

<p>"Won't you motor down to the station
with me, please, Jack?" Lord Kent added,
hastily, anxious to get away as soon as possible
from the situation he had created.</p>

<p>Jack slipped on a long tan coat and soft
hat and went with her husband, leaving
Olive to look after Frieda.</p>

<p>"Bryan is expecting to be here again this
afternoon for a farewell visit, dear. He has
been delayed for some reason or other but
hopes to leave with his regiment tomorrow,"
Frank announced on the way to his train. "Do
you know I think Bryan is a lucky fellow these
days, not to have anyone very close to him&mdash;anyone
who cares very much what becomes
of him. Oh, of course, I should care, more
than I like to think; but I mean no mother
or father&mdash;no family."</p>

<p>"I should also care a great deal, Frank,"
Jack interrupted quietly.</p>

<p>But Lord Kent went on, scarcely hearing
her.</p>

<p>"It is a funny thing that Bryan has never
married. He is an uncommonly fascinating<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
fellow. Of course, he hasn't much money;
but that ought not to stand in his way. He
has his profession. Queer, when he was a boy
he used to talk about being an artist; but
there is a lot of difference between an artist
and a soldier. He must be glad now of his
choice. Sometimes I think Bryan has never
married because he has never seen any woman
as attractive as you are. He has almost
said as much to me."</p>

<p>Jack shook her head almost angrily. "That
is nonsense, Frank. After all, you know
Bryan is pretty young; there is no use talking
as if he were a confirmed old bachelor."</p>

<p>After lunch that same afternoon Captain
MacDonnell rode over to Kent House. He
was wearing his service uniform of khaki&mdash;the
short military coat, the full trousers drawn
close at the knees and the high boots. He
also wore the British officer's cap with the
small visor and the other marks of his rank.</p>

<p>Hearing the sound of his horse approaching,
Jack went out on the veranda to greet him.
Frieda was upstairs in her room and Olive was
writing letters to Ruth Colter and Jean at
the Rainbow Ranch.</p>

<p>In her arms Jack carried her baby, with
whom she had been playing. Indeed, ever<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
since the news of war, some member of the
family had seemed to wish to hold Vive, for
her baby softness and sweetness was in some
way a consolation.</p>

<p>Jack had her baby's little yellow head
pressed close against her bronze colored hair
and made the baby wave its hand to the
young officer as he drew nearer.</p>

<p>When he came up to them on the veranda
he kissed Vive's tiny hand.</p>

<p>"May I have one of Vive's blue ribbons
to tie in my buttonhole, please, Lady
Jacqueline?" he asked. "Lady Jacqueline"
being a title which Captain MacDonnell had
originated for Jack, but which many other
people also used. "Every knight, when he
went off to the wars in the old days, wore his
lady's colors. I should like to have Vive for
my lady."</p>

<p>Jack felt her fingers trembling a little as she
unfastened the ribbon from her baby's sleeve
and gave it to her friend.</p>

<p>"Won't you take a farewell ride with me
this afternoon, Jack?" Captain MacDonnell
asked the next instant. "It will be the best
way to manage our good-bye."</p>

<p>For just the fraction of a second Jack hesitated.
Yet, in that time, she had a sufficient<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
opportunity to think over the entire situation.
Captain MacDonnell had not asked her to
ride with him since the afternoon, when her
recklessness had displeased Frank. Since
then she had never attempted to persuade
Frank that his demand, that she never ride
with Captain MacDonnell again, was unreasonable.
Nevertheless, she felt fairly sure that
under the present circumstance he could not
object. Surely, Frank could not be so
ungracious as to be vexed with her for disobeying
his wish at such a time. She would,
of course, ride carefully and take no foolish
risks.</p>

<p>Jack gave Vive into Captain MacDonnell's
keeping.</p>

<p>"Yes, I'll go if you'll come back to dinner
with Frank and the rest of us," she agreed.
"I'll be ready in five minutes."</p>

<p>Jack sent the nurse to look after the baby
and in ten minutes was ready for the ride.</p>

<p>It was a sultry August afternoon, very still,
and yet with a strange throbbing in the air
of many tiny insects. The hawthorn was no
longer in bloom, but the two friends rode
along the English lanes sweet with blossoming
elderberry and blackberry bushes.</p>

<p>Curious how, when one comes to say farewell,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
there is so little that seems worth
saying!</p>

<p>During the first part of the ride Jack and
Captain MacDonnell were frequently silent,
except that Jack, of course, made the conventional
inquiries one might ask of a soldier.
Was he in good condition? Did he have
everything he needed? Was there anything
she could do for him&mdash;such as looking after
his house while he was gone?</p>

<p>In response to each question Captain
MacDonnell shook his head. He had turned
over his house to be used for the Belgian
refugees.</p>

<p>They were actually on their way home
before he began to talk.</p>

<p>Then he took a letter from his pocket.</p>

<p>"I wish you would give this to Frank for
me, Lady Jack, and if anything happens to
me ask him to read it, and to let you read it
afterwards if he thinks best. Sorry to be
mysterious, but this is a kind of cranky wish
of mine."</p>

<p>Jack slipped the letter inside the coat she
was wearing.</p>

<p>"All right, Bryan. You know I have
always felt rather like a big sister to you; I
am nearly a year older. But, today I think<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
I feel like your mother," she continued, trying
to smile, but with her voice breaking a little.
"So you must promise me, if there is anything
I can ever do for you later on you will let me
know. In a way I believe I am almost
envious of you, Bryan. I think I have wanted
to be a boy ever since I could sit on the back
of a horse and ride over our ranch with my
father. That is why people have always
called me 'Jack,' I suppose. Anyhow, just
now, I think I would like to go out to meet a
great adventure. I wonder what a woman's
great adventure is. I presume it is marriage
for most of us. At any rate Frank is terribly
envious of you, Bryan. He has said so to me
half a dozen times. He does not seem to
know whether he ought to go to the front,
which is what he wants to do, or to stay on
here doing his work in Parliament. Of course,
he ought to stay," Jack argued, repeating
what she had been saying a good many times
to her husband recently. "There never was
a time when a member of Parliament had
such great work to do, and that is Frank's
real duty."</p>

<p>When Jack gave Captain MacDonnell's
letter to her husband that night she spoke of
their having had a ride together. Although<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
he made no comment, she could see that he
was not altogether pleased. It occurred to
Jack then, though only vaguely, that if
Frank objected to her disobeying him in small
matters, their life might be pretty difficult
if ever they had a difference of opinion and
she disobeyed him in a large one.</p>

<p>"Strange for Bryan to have confided this
letter to us," Frank remarked, as he put it
carefully away in a strong box where he kept
his important papers. "I wonder what old
Bryan has written? I never dreamed he had a
secret in his life which he has never told to
me. But, perhaps he wants us to do some
favor or other for him. Truly I hope we
may never have to open the letter."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>SEVERAL MONTHS LATER<br /><br /><br /></div>


<div class='cap'>FRIEDA read a letter she had just
received and laughed.</div>

<p>Laughter was not frequent at Kent
House those days, so that Jack and Olive
looked up from the work they were doing.
Olive was rolling bandages and Jack was
writing notes at her desk. The three of them
were in Jack's private sitting room where, only
a few moments before, the afternoon mail bag
had been brought in.</p>

<p>"What is it, Frieda?" Jack asked, turning
her head to glance over her shoulder in some
surprise at her sister. She wondered if Frieda
realized that she was fully aware of the way
in which she had been watching the mail for
these past few months. For Frieda had
watched in vain for the particular letter which
certainly she seemed to expect; even if she did
not greatly desire it.</p>

<p>"Oh, I have just received a note from a
young soldier to whom I sent the first pair of
socks I ever made," she returned. "He may<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
not have originated the poem, but it is almost
worth the trouble and the time I took on the
socks. Do listen:"</p>

<div class='poem'>
"Thanks, dear lady, for the socks you knit;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Some socks, some fit.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">I used one for a hammock and the other for a mitt.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">I hope I meet you when I've done my bit,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">But where in the h... did you learn to knit?"</span><br />
</div>

<p>Then Frieda dropped the letter to wave
another long grey sock, shot through with
shining knitting needles. It was somewhat
narrow in the ankle and bulged strangely at
the heel.</p>

<p>"I wonder if I am improving?" she
inquired anxiously. The utilitarian nature
of Frieda's occupation contrasted curiously
with the general fluffiness of her appearance.
For no amount of inward anguish could ever
keep Frieda from the desire to wear pretty
clothes and to make herself as attractive as
possible. However, no one had any right
to say she was unhappy, except as every one
else was, through sympathy with the added
troubles which the war had lately brought
upon the world.</p>

<p>Like most of the other women in the
larger part of Europe and also in the United<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
States, Jack and Olive were devoting all their
energies to the work of the war. They had
both taken short courses in Red Cross nursing
and had organized clubs and classes in the
neighborhood for every kind of relief work,
while Frank had turned over several of his
houses to the Belgian refugees.</p>

<p>Therefore, only Frieda remained more or
less on the outside of things. She had undertaken
to learn to knit for the soldiers, but
insisted that since her name meant peace and
was a German name as well, she would do
nothing more. The truth was she seemed not
to wish to go out or mix with society a great
deal, which was odd, as one of the reasons she
had given for her unhappiness in her own
home was that her husband wished to spend
too much time there, so that she had become
bored.</p>

<p>However, Frieda had agreed to visit the
poor people on the estate and in the neighboring
village, in order to relieve Jack from this
one of her many duties.</p>

<p>Moreover, she enjoyed the odd types of
old men and women, so unlike any other
people whom she had ever before known, and
she became a great favorite with them.
Instead of giving her money for war purposes<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
Frieda preferred bestowing it on these same
queer old persons and the children who had
been left behind.</p>

<p>This afternoon, after she had finished
reading the second of her two letters, the
latter from Jean in Wyoming, Frieda got up
from her chair.</p>

<p>"Jimmie and I are going to drive down to
the village to see old Dame Quick," she
announced, "I promised to read to her this
afternoon." 'Dame Quick' was the title
Frieda had borrowed to give to the oldest
woman in Granchester, because she was so
extraordinarily lively.</p>

<p>"What will you do with Jimmie while you
read? He will never keep still," Jack called,
as Frieda moved toward the door.</p>

<p>Frieda paused. "Oh, he and nurse will
return back in the governess cart. I want
to walk home. Don't worry if I am a little
late," and before Olive or Jack would speak,
she had disappeared.</p>

<p>"I hope Frieda won't be too long. She
does not know this country as I do," Jack
murmured afterwards, but not thinking of
the matter seriously.</p>

<p>Frieda and Jimmie had a way of jogging in
the little governess cart on many afternoons,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
sometimes taking the nurse with them and
more often not. Jimmie was rather a troublesome
small boy of an age when he was into
every kind of mischief, and Frieda was not
fond of children. Therefore, her family had
wondered why she appeared to desire so much
of Jimmie's companionship. Frieda might
have answered that he asked so many
questions that she did not have time to think
of other things; however, she had never said
this, even to herself.</p>

<p>The governess cart was a little wicker
carriage swung low on two wheels, with an
ancient, shaggy pony, who never moved out
of a slow trot.</p>

<p>That afternoon, like all the great ladies in
the English novels, Frieda stored away under
the seat of her cart as much jelly and jam as
her sister's housekeeper would allow her.
At the nearest grocery shop she bought a
package of tea, some tins of biscuits and a
half pound of tobacco. For the truth was
that Frieda's old woman liked a quiet smoke.
This habit was not common among the
villagers, but Dame Quick whose real name
was "Huggins" was so very old that she
allowed herself certain privileges.</p>

<p>It was a dismal late fall afternoon, but<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
English people and particularly English children
do not stay indoors because of bad
weather.</p>

<p>Frieda wore a blue rain proof coat and a
soft hat which she pulled down over her
yellow hair, to keep the soft mist out of her
eyes as well as she could. Jimmie and his
nurse were also enveloped in mackintoshes.</p>

<p>But the rain was not actually falling. There
was only a November haze and a pervading
dampness, making Jimmie's cheeks redder
than ever and bringing more color than was
usual to Frieda's face.</p>

<p>On the way to the village Jimmie and his
aunt, whom he regarded as of his own age,
sang "America" in not a particularly musical
fashion, but with a great deal of earnest
effort, since Frieda was trying to teach the
British Jimmie to be more of an American.</p>

<p>Jimmie, of course, wished to go into Mrs.
Huggins' cottage with his aunt, but on that
point Frieda was resolute. She had a fancy
for seeing her old friend alone this afternoon.
Actually she had a reason which had been
developing in her mind for the past twenty-four
hours, although Frieda herself considered
her reason nonsensical.</p>

<p>In answer to her knock the old woman came<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
to the door. She looked like one of the
pictures one remembers in the Mother Goose
books, and also like one of them, "she lived
alone, all in her little house of stone."</p>

<p>Dame Quick's cottage of two rooms was
set in the middle of a long row of little stone
houses, in one of the half a dozen streets in
Granchester. Frieda always felt a shiver as
she went inside, since the floor was of stone
and there was a dampness about the little
house as if it had never been thoroughly
warmed inside by the sun.</p>

<p>Yet Mrs. Huggins had managed to live
there in contentment for about seventy years.
She had come there as a bride before she was
twenty and was now "ninety or thereabouts,"
as she described herself.</p>

<p>When Frieda entered she bobbed up and
down as quickly as an old brown cork on a
running stream.</p>

<p>"Sure, I've been waitin' and longin' for the
sight of you these two hours," she said, taking
Frieda's packages, or as many as she could get
hold of, as if she thought them too burdensome
for the young woman to carry.</p>

<p>Frieda laughed and slipped out of her rain
coat, which she hung carefully on a small
wooden chair. Then she also laid her hat on<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
the chair and, as a matter of habit, fluffed
up her pretty hair which the rain and her hat
had flattened, and then followed her old
hostess.</p>

<p>"You know you have had half a dozen
visitors during the two hours you say you
have been waiting, Mrs. Huggins," Frieda
returned. For it was true that the tiny house
and the old woman were the center of all the
gossip in the village. "I expect you to tell
me a lot of news."</p>

<p>The old woman nodded.</p>

<p>"It is true these are news days in England
and elsewhere. Times were, when the days
might be dull without a birth or a death, or a
mating. But now one wakes up to something
stirrin' every day&mdash;a lad goin' off to the
war, or maybe one gettin' killed; and the girls
coomin' in to tell me their troubles; some of
them just married, and some of them not
married at all yet. But all of them worryin'
their hearts out. Sure, and if war is goin' on
forever&mdash;and it looks like it is&mdash;I'm for the
women goin' into battle along with their
men."</p>

<p>While she was talking Frieda had followed
her hostess back into her kitchen&mdash;the room
in which she really lived and had her being.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
It was also of stone, but the floor had a number
of bright rag rugs as covering and the
walls were lined with pictures cut from papers
and magazines, and with picture postcards.
One could have gotten a pretty fair knowledge
of English history at the moment by studying
Mrs. Huggins' picture gallery. She had on
her walls a photograph of nearly every
British officer then in command of the army
or navy. She had replicas of innumerable
battleships and also of statesmen. But in
the place of honor over a shelf that held her
Bible and a tiny daguerreotype of the late,
lamented Mr. Huggins, hung a picture of
England's big little man&mdash;Lloyd George.
The aged woman received the old age pension
which Lloyd George had given to the poor of
England a few years before the outbreak of
the present war.</p>

<p>Frieda sat down on a little chair which
lovers of antiques would have given much
to possess. There was a small fire burning
in the tiny stove, and its red coals looked
more cheerful than the great log fire at Kent
House.</p>

<p>Frieda knew that Dame Quick would wish
to prepare the tea herself.</p>

<p>She had rather a happy feeling as she<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
watched Mrs. Huggins, as if she had been a
little girl who had gone out one day and
grown suddenly tired and forlorn, and then
been unexpectedly invited into the very
gingerbread house itself. But a gingerbread
house presided over by a good spirit, not an
evil one.</p>

<p>Her own little Dame Quick looked like a
child's idea of an ancient good fairy. She
may not have been so small to begin with,
but at ninety she was bent over until she
seemed very tiny indeed. Her face was
brown and wrinkled and her eyes shone forth
as black as elderberries in the late gathering
time.</p>

<p>She placed a small wooden table in front of
Frieda and not far from the fire and her own
chair. Then she got out some heavy plates
and two cups and saucers. And whatever
the difference in elegance, tea is never so
good served in a thin cup as in a thick one.
Afterwards she opened the package containing
Frieda's biscuits and jam and finally poured
boiling water into her own brown stone tea
kettle.</p>

<p>Then she and Frieda, sitting on opposite
sides of the tea table, talked and talked.</p>

<p>Several times, as she sat there, Frieda<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
thought that if she had been an English girl
she would like to have had just such an old
nurse or foster mother as Mrs. Huggins. For
she might then have been able to confide a
number of things to her&mdash;matters she could
not talk about even to her sister, since she
was not clear enough how she felt concerning
them herself, and so Jack might get wrong
impressions.</p>

<p>"But you have not told me any special news
this afternoon," Frieda protested, having
lifted her cup for a second helping of tea,
and making up her mind that she could not
think of herself while visiting, as she usually
did at home. "My sister and brother always
expect me to know something interesting
after a visit to you."</p>

<p>Dame Quick poured the tea carefully.</p>

<p>"I don't care for gossip," she returned,
"yet it seems as if they like it as much in big
houses as in little." Her eyes snapped, so
that Frieda found herself watching them,
fascinated.</p>

<p>"Since you came in I've been wonderin'
whether certain information should
be sent to Lord and Lady Kent. I don't
think much of it myself, as there has been
such a steady stream of spy talk these<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
months past. But they are tellin' in Granchester
that there is a man there who has
taken a house a short distance from the
village, on the road to Kent House. It seems
he keeps to himself too much to please the
village. He says he has been ill, and I'm
sure has a right to a mite of peace if he wants
it. It's only the village that's talking. Those
higher up must know things are what they
should be, since they don't bother him."</p>

<p>Frieda was scarcely listening. Mrs. Huggins'
news was often uninteresting in itself.
It was only that she so much enjoyed repeating
it.</p>

<p>She had already finished her second cup of
tea and was looking down at the collection of
tea leaves in the bottom of her cup.</p>

<p>"Suppose you tell my fortune," she suggested
rather shyly. For some time past she
had been thinking of just this. "Didn't you
say you sometimes told the fortunes of the
boys and girls in Granchester, and that a
great many things you predict come true?"</p>

<p>The old country woman looked at Frieda
sharply.</p>

<p>"I tell the fortunes, child, of boys and girls
whose grandfathers and grandmothers I once
knew. That isn't difficult fortune telling. I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
know certain tricks in the faces, I remember
what their own people thought and did long
before their day. Like father, like son; or
maybe like mother, like son; and like father,
like daughter. But you&mdash;" The old woman
shook her head. "I know nothing about you,
child; or your country, or your people, or
what you have made of life for yourself with
that pretty face of yours."</p>

<p>Still Frieda held out her tea cup.</p>

<p>"Oh, well; just let the tea leaves show you
a little," she pleaded, in the spoiled fashion
by which Frieda usually accomplished her
purpose.</p>

<p>Still the old peasant continued to look, not
at the tea leaves but at her young companion.
Perhaps she saw something with her fine,
tired old eyes, that were too dim to read
print, which even Frieda's own family did
not see.</p>

<p>"You have had too many of the things
you wish without ever having to work for
them, or to wait, little lady," she repeated
slowly. Then she glanced down into the
extended tea cup. "I think I see that you
will have to lose something before you find
out that you care for it. I also see a long
journey, some clouds and at last a rainbow."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span></p>

<p>Frieda put down her cup and laughed a
little uncertainly.</p>

<p>"Oh, the Rainbow Ranch is the name of my
own home. I wonder if I have ever told you
that?" she inquired. "But you are mistaken
if you think I have had the things I wish."
For, of course, Frieda did not believe she had
been a fortunate person. So few people ever
do believe this of themselves, until misfortune
makes them learn through contrast.</p>

<p>Later, she read a chapter in the Bible and
the war news from one of the morning papers.
Then, before six o'clock, she started to return
to Kent House.</p>

<p>Frieda walked quickly as the distance was
not short. Moreover, she had never entirely
recovered from the fright of her unexpected
encounter with her husband several months
before. Yet, since then, she had not only
never seen him again, but never heard anything
about him, except the scant information
of his departure to France, which she had
acquired through Frank Kent.</p>

<p>Frieda did think&mdash;no matter what the
difference between them&mdash;that her husband
might have let her know that he was at least
alive and well. Of course she was a selfish,
cold-hearted person, as her family and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
undoubtedly her own husband believed her
to be. However, one could be interested in
the welfare of even a comparative stranger
in war times.</p>

<p>Later, after Frieda left the village, she
passed by the little house which her old
friend had tried to involve in a mystery in
order to supply her with gossip. The house
was set in a yard by itself. The lights were
lighted and the curtains drawn down, but, as
she hurried by, either a woman's or a man's
figure made a dark shadow upon the closed
blind.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>CHURCH AND STATE<br /><br /><br /></div>


<div class='cap'>THE family and a number of the
servants from Kent House were on
their way to the small Episcopal
church at the edge of the estate.</div>

<p>Jack and Frank were walking in front, with
Olive and Frieda strolling a little more slowly
behind them, and the rest of the company
followed in scattered groups.</p>

<p>At the beginning of her marriage the English
Sundays had been a trial to Jack. They were
so much more quiet, so much more sedate
than those of her rather too unconventional
girlhood in Wyoming. Then they had sometimes
held church in the open air, or if they
wished to go into the nearest town, a big
wagon was loaded with as many persons as
could be persuaded from the ranch, and
ordinarily they stopped on the way back and
had lunch somewhere. Now and then Jack
even remembered having ridden on her own
broncho to the church door and fastened
it on the outside, while she went in to the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
service in a costume which was an odd cross
between a riding habit and a church outfit.</p>

<p>But now, although the walk across Kent
Park was only a short one, Jack was as correctly
attired as if she were in London.
Beside her brown velvet costume which was
very smart and becoming, she wore a hat
with feathers, which she particularly disliked.
The hat was of the kind affected by Queen
Mary of England, who always wears feather-trimmed
hats.</p>

<p>However, the mere matter of her hat would
not have made Jack feel out of sorts, if she
had not had another more potent reason.
Frank was nearly always cross on Sunday
mornings and this morning was no exception.</p>

<p>It is strange that Sunday should have this
effect on many persons, when one should be
more cheerful than usual, and yet it does.</p>

<p>Frank was really worn out with all his
worries and responsibilities, Jack decided to
herself, as she had a number of times recently.
It was a privilege many people take advantage
of, by saving their bad humors for their
families.</p>

<p>"But, Frank, I don't think you understand
the situation in the United States,"
Jack argued, speaking good naturedly. "You<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
see, we represent so many nationalities, so
many differences of opinion and training, that
we can't all think alike. The President is
supposed to represent everybody."</p>

<p>"Nonsense," Frank interrupted his wife
not too politely. "The United States has
been thinking about nothing but getting rich.
They are a nation of shirkers, willing to stand
back and let others do the work and suffer
the loss."</p>

<p>"There are a good many millions of us for
us all to be shirkers, Frank," Jack answered,
still speaking quietly, although her cheeks had
flushed and her eyes darkened.</p>

<p>Really she and Frank tried very hard not to
discuss any differences of opinion they felt
concerning the war. During the last few
years the marriages between men and women
of different nationalities have had a great
strain put upon them. At present, Frank as
an Englishman, thought that the United
States should immediately have gone in upon
the side of the Allies, while Jack did not;
and now and then they unfortunately fell into
a discussion of the subject.</p>

<p>Therefore, when they entered church this
Sunday morning, neither Jack nor Frank were
in a good humor toward each other. Jack<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
felt that, as she was doing all she could in the
service of his country, he should have made
no unkind criticism of hers. Frank did not
think at all, except to wish that Jack would
refrain from argument. Certainly a man
wished for peace in his own home when it was
nowhere else. But it did not occur to Frank
that it takes two to keep peace as well as two
to make a quarrel; nor did he begin to realize
how trying he had been at home during the
past few months.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact Frank was spoiled, as
many Englishmen and some American men
are. He had been an only son who was to
inherit the family title, and his mother and
sisters had always put him first in all things.
It was true that when he came to the United
States he had fallen in love with Jacqueline
Ralston because, for one reason, she did not
treat him differently at the beginning of their
acquaintance from any cowboy on her ranch.
That is, she was perfectly polite to him, when
she remembered his existence; but then she
was polite to everybody and recognized no
social distinctions. She liked her own freedom,
allowed other people theirs, and went
her way untroubled by the opinion of others.</p>

<p>But, at present&mdash;as is often the case with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
men after they marry&mdash;the very things in
Jack which had attracted Frank before
marriage annoyed him now. He believed
she ought to be more influenced by his views.
Of course, she ordinarily gave in to his wishes.
However, he seldom felt as if she were convinced,
but believed she yielded through
sheer sweet temper.</p>

<p>Moreover, Frank's irritability continued
all day, so that several times after their
return home, Jack found herself mortified
before Olive and Frieda. Not that she minded
so much about Olive, since Olive and Frank
had always understood each other. But, as
Frieda had announced herself as being
disappointed with marriage, Jack did not
wish her to think that her own was also a
failure.</p>

<p>After their midday luncheon on Sunday it
was always Lord and Lady Kent's custom to
walk over their estate during the afternoon,
visit the stables and see as much of the condition
of the place and the people on it as was
possible.</p>

<p>This Sunday afternoon Frank arose and
started to go on his usual rounds without
suggesting that Jack accompany him.</p>

<p>However, she paid no attention to this, but<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
followed him. Outdoors he changed into a
better mood.</p>

<p>There were not many horses left in the
stables, as most of them were being used by
the army. But when Jack and Frank went
into the kennels, which adjoined the stables,
a dozen great dogs began leaping over them at
once.</p>

<p>Frank drew a little aside to watch his wife.</p>

<p>Jack stood in their midst laughing and
protesting a little when one big hound stuck
its great head, with wide open jaws and lolling
tongue, too near her face. Yet she managed
to make them all happy and quiet again by
patting and stroking each one, or by calling
each dog by name.</p>

<p>"You are not afraid of anything in the
world, are you, Jack?" Frank remarked
admiringly, as they again got safely away
from the kennels, Jack finding it necessary
at the last moment to remove two large paws
from her shoulders in order to settle a dispute
between two of the other dogs.</p>

<p>Jack laughed. "Goodness, Frank, what
an extraordinary opinion you and a few other
people have of me! I am one of the biggest
cowards in the world about the things I am
afraid of. I simply don't happen to be afraid<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
of animals, as so many women are. And
that is not a virtue, but because I was brought
up with them."</p>

<p>"I should like to know what you do fear,
then?" Frank demanded.</p>

<p>Instead of answering at once Jack slipped
her arm inside her husband's.</p>

<p>"I am dreadfully afraid of the people I care
about being angry with me, though you and
the rest of my family may not believe it, as
I am supposed to have once been a wilful
person," she returned unexpectedly. "Sometimes
I wonder, Frank, just how much of a
coward I would be, if I had either to give up
what I thought was right or else to have some
one seriously angry with me. I have not the
courage of my convictions like Frieda."</p>

<p>In response Frank uttered a half growl,
which was not very complimentary to Frieda
or her convictions. However, Jack went on
almost without pausing.</p>

<p>"I wonder, Frank, if it is fair to Frieda not
to let her know what has happened to Professor
Russell? Sometimes I have thought
she has worried more over his silence than we
imagine."</p>

<p>Frank shook his head.</p>

<p>"Frieda deserves whatever may come to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
her. It is an old-fashioned axiom, dear,
but all the more true for that reason: Frieda
has made her bed; now let her lie upon it."</p>

<p>"But Frieda is hardly more than a child,"
Jack protested. "Besides, that is a pretty
hard rule to apply to people. I don't think
you and I would like to have it applied to us
if we were ever in any difficulty."</p>

<p>As it struck Frank as utterly impossible
that he and Jack ever could have a disagreement,
which could not be settled amiably in
a few hours, he paid no attention to her last
statement. Nevertheless he added:</p>

<p>"After all, Jack, it is not for us to decide
anything concerning Frieda and her husband.
That is for them. We are simply doing what
Professor Russell has requested of us."</p>

<p>"Yes, but Frieda," Jack expostulated more
weakly.</p>

<p>"Frieda is receiving just what she asked for&mdash;silence.
But you must not worry over
Frieda. She will solve existence happily for
herself soon enough. Almost any man would
do anything and forgive anything in behalf
of such blue eyes and yellow hair as Frieda's
to say nothing of her Professor. I may pretend
to be severe but I should probably forgive
her as readily."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span></p>

<p>"Sooner than you would me?" Jack inquired
and laughed. "Oh, of course, you would.
Everybody always has as long as I can
remember."</p>

<p>Frank looked more closely at his wife and
his face softened until his eyes held their old
expression of boyish admiration. Always he
had been pleased by her intense loyalty to the
people she cared for. It had made him forgive
her in the past when she had some mistaken
idea of loyalty toward Olive.</p>

<p>"I am afraid you have had to do the forgiving
recently, Jack. I expect I have been
difficult. But I feel so torn these days wanting
to be over in France doing the real work with
fellows like Bryan, and at the same time
wanting to be here with you and the babies
and knowing I am perhaps more useful in
London than I would be elsewhere."</p>

<p>Jack's clear grey eyes were full of the spiritual
understanding that had made her always
so valuable a friend, and a woman must be a
friend to her husband as well as other things.</p>

<p>"I know, Frank," she answered, "but you
are doing the right thing. If I didn't think
so, no matter how I should suffer, do you
believe for a moment that I would stand in
your way?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span></p>

<p>And catching her look, Frank replied.</p>

<p>"No, Jack, I don't; but I thank you for
understanding."</p>

<p>There were no letters delivered at Kent
House on Sunday, but on each Sunday afternoon
one of the men drove over to the post-office,
which was open for an hour, and
returned with the mail. It was important
that Lord Kent should be kept in touch with
every situation that arose, as there might be
grave and tragic developments in the course
of the hours he sometimes spent away from
London.</p>

<p>As he picked up the mail which was lying
on the table in the hall as they entered, Frank
extended a letter to his wife.</p>

<p>"This is from Bryan, I believe, Jack. Do
tell me what he says."</p>

<p>They went into the library where Frieda and
Olive were already waiting for tea to be served.</p>

<p>Jack walked over to the fire and, before
taking off her hat, read her letter through
quietly.</p>

<p>Then she looked up happily.</p>

<p>"Bryan says he is all right and sends his
love to the family, but more especially to his
Lady Vive. He asks us all to write to him
oftener if we can manage it, as we are his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
adopted family and he has no other. Frieda,
he says your gift of socks is the most wonderful
in all France. I actually believe Bryan is
almost having a good time; but if he is not
he is awfully brave."</p>

<p>Making no effort to conceal her emotion,
Jack's eyes suddenly filled with tears.</p>

<p>"Gracious, Jack," Frieda exclaimed. "As
long as there is nothing the matter with
Captain MacDonnell, I wouldn't shed any
tears over him. You so seldom cry, it always
makes me wretched when you do. I'll bet Jack
has never shed any tears over you, Frank."</p>

<p>Frieda was not like a kitten in appearance
alone. She had also soft little claws with which
she scratched a tiny bit now and then. She
had been entirely conscious that her brother-in-law
considered that she was to blame in a
large measure for her trouble with her husband,
although he had never said so to her.
Yet she had a desire to get a little bit even with
him now and then.</p>

<p>Frank's face did flush slightly, although
he smiled good humoredly.</p>

<p>"Oh, I am nothing but a civilian these days
and Bryan is a soldier. I can't expect the
same interest to be bestowed upon me, even
by my own wife."</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER X</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>THE LETTER<br /><br /><br /></div>


<div class='cap'>AS soon as Jack saw Frank's face she
realized that something tragic had
occurred.</div>

<p>She had come down to the train alone to
meet him, but said nothing until they had
walked away from the little crowd at the
station into the gloom of the midwinter
afternoon.</p>

<p>"It is Bryan," Frank then exclaimed without
waiting to be asked. "I had word from
the War Office today that he had been
mortally wounded."</p>

<p>He put his arm about Jack to support her if
she should turn faint, but this was not the way
Jack received bad news.</p>

<p>She stopped for a moment, standing
straight, however, with her head up and her
shoulders braced.</p>

<p>"Are you sure, Frank, there can be no
mistake?" she asked slowly.</p>

<p>Lord Kent shook his head.</p>

<p>"I am afraid not, dear. Bryan was leading<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
a charge out of his trench when a shell hit
him. His own men carried him back to a
field hospital."</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 316px;">

<span class="caption">His Own Men Carried Him Back to a Field Hospital</span>
</div>

<p>Jack and Frank then walked slowly on
between the winter fields. The grass was
still green as it remains almost all the year
round in England, but the trees were stripped
and bare, and there were no birds in sight,
except a few melancholy crows, which in
England are called rooks.</p>

<p>Jack was recalling the day when she and
Captain MacDonnell had taken their last
ride together; also the smell of the blossoming
hedges and her baby's blue ribbon on his
sleeve.</p>

<p>Since coming to England as a bride, she
and Frank and Bryan had enjoyed a charming
friendship. It was to Bryan, Frank had
first introduced her, asking that he help to
make her less homesick for the ranch and
her own people.</p>

<p>In those days Frank's sisters were still
unmarried and Bryan had been in the habit
of spending much of his time at Kent House
when he was on leave.</p>

<p>Yet Frank and Bryan were so utterly unlike
in temperament. To say that Frank was an
Englishman and Bryan an Irishman explains<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
a great deal. Frank was quieter and more
reserved and determined; but Bryan was
ardent and emotional, quick to feel an emotion
and quick to change. Jack had always
felt that he loved the outdoors as she did,
while Frank was studious, more devoted to
books and to political questions than to swift
action.</p>

<p>At the same time Frank and his wife were
thinking along similar lines, although his
recollection of his friend went further back
than hers. He remembered the small boy,
whose mother had just died, coming to live
with his old bachelor guardian in the queer
little house which had since belonged to him.
He also remembered how shy he had been and
yet how often he had gotten into fights with
other boys. But, more than anything, he
recalled how Bryan had always seemed to
long for the companionship of women and how
happy he had been to come to Kent House
and spend hours and days with his mother
and sisters. This was one of the reasons why
it had always seemed strange to Frank that
his friend had never married.</p>

<p>"But the news only said that Bryan was
fatally hurt&mdash;not that things were over?"
Jack asked after their long pause.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes; but I'm afraid he may be by now,"
Frank answered. "I have sent half a dozen
cables for more news."</p>

<p>Jack's grey eyes cleared a little.</p>

<p>"Then I won't believe the worst until it
really happens."</p>

<p>On their arrival at home Olive and Frieda
were sympathetic, but naturally could not
care as much as Jack and Frank, since Captain
MacDonnell was to them only a comparatively
new acquaintance.</p>

<p>But all evening Frieda watched her sister
closely, whenever she had the opportunity
without being observed. Only a few times
before had she seen her with the same
expression.</p>

<p>Half a dozen or more of the neighbors
came in after dinner to ask for further information
concerning Captain MacDonnell, having
heard the news only indirectly.</p>

<p>But among them all Jack was the only one
who appeared hopeful. She outwardly showed
the effect of the anxiety and grief over their
friend far less than Frank. But Frieda at
least realized that courage was her sister's
strongest characteristic.</p>

<p>There had always been something gallant
about Jack from the time she was a little girl&mdash;the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
carriage of her head; the look in her eyes&mdash;everything
about her revealed this.</p>

<p>And tonight Frieda appreciated the fact
more clearly than any one else. There was
no friend in the world so loyal as Jack; and
no one more anxious to help those for whom
she cared. Frieda knew that whatever else
she might say during the evening, she was in
reality thinking only of her husband's friend
and her own, alone and dying, perhaps with
no one near him for whom he cared.</p>

<p>As early as possible Jack and Frank went
upstairs together, since Frank showed the
effect of the strain by being uncommonly tired.</p>

<p>They had gone into their own rooms and
Jack was slowly beginning to undress when
an idea came to her; and she went at once
into her husband's room.</p>

<p>Frank, she found sitting on the side of his
bed.</p>

<p>"Bryan's letter, Frank," Jack remarked
quickly. "Don't you think you ought to
open it? He said that if anything happened
to him you were to read it first, and afterwards
I was to see the letter if you thought best.
I remember he seemed much in earnest when
he gave it to me."</p>

<p>Frank frowned, and then shook his head.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span></p>

<p>"Do you know I had forgotten, Jack?
But I don't think Bryan meant us to disturb
the letter until we know that the worst has
happened to him and we don't know this
yet; we only fear it."</p>

<p>For a moment Jack was silent, but when she
spoke again her voice and manner expressed
a quiet firmness.</p>

<p>"I think you are mistaken, Frank. There
must be something in Bryan's letter that he
wants us to do for him. It may be something
that would come afterwards, but it also may
be something that we could do for him now.
Of course you must judge, but this is the way
I feel about it."</p>

<p>Jack, who had put on a deep violet toned
velvet dressing gown over her underclothes,
now sat down in an arm chair, leaning thoughtfully
forward and resting her chin in the palm
of her hand.</p>

<p>She did not intend to influence her husband;
but having expressed her own thought, she
quietly awaited his decision.</p>

<p>Frank, however, was worried and undecided.
In order to think more clearly, he got up and
began walking nervously up and down his
room.</p>

<p>"I don't know what to do, Jack," he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
argued. "If Bryan still lives he may, of
course, recover and I would not then like
to feel that I have pryed into his secret.
On the other hand, you may be right and
Bryan may have made some simple request
of us which we could carry out for
him at once. Bryan is a sentimental chap
always. I wish, this time, he had been more
explicit."</p>

<p>Nevertheless, Frank must have finally
decided to accept his wife's point of view for,
after another few moments, he walked over
to a small safe which occupied a corner in his
room and opened it. Then he took out the
box in which he had placed Captain MacDonnell's
letter and the next instant had
broken the seal and was reading its contents.</p>

<p>Jack sat watching her husband's face, but
offered no interruption.</p>

<p>She saw Frank first look surprised and then
saw him flush and at last his expression
hardened curiously. He then <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'prsented'">presented</ins> her
with the letter.</p>

<p>"Read this, Jack. It is just as well that
you should know what is in it. Bryan must
have been considerably upset over his farewells
and the thought of what might lie ahead
of him, or he would never have made such a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
request of us. He must have realized afterwards
that the thing is impossible."</p>

<p>Jack read the letter, but there was nothing
in it which seemed strange; certainly nothing
impossible to her point of view. Bryan had
simply requested that Frank allow her to
come to him in case he was seriously injured.
Bryan explained simply and boyishly that
he had no women in his own family and that
she was his closest woman friend. He had an
absurd horror of dying with no woman near
for whom he cared, or who cared for him.</p>

<p>"I don't see what you find impossible,
Frank," Jack answered, placing the letter
inside the envelope and quickly returning it.
"I was only waiting until we heard more
news to ask you to let me go to Bryan, even
if he had not made this request of us."</p>

<p>Frank appeared distressed, but shook his
head resolutely.</p>

<p>"I don't want to seem unkind, dear. In
a way it is pretty hard to refuse what Bryan
asks. Only he could not have appreciated
just how much he was asking."</p>

<p>Jack brushed her hair back from her forehead
with a puzzled gesture.</p>

<p>"I don't understand what you mean,
Frank. Certainly neither of us can dream of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
not agreeing. I know you will worry over the
discomfort, perhaps even the danger of the
trip to France for me. But hundreds of
women have gone and are going every day
to care for the soldiers who are entire strangers
to them. Many times I have wanted to go
myself before this, except for leaving you
and my babies behind. But now I may only
need to stay a little time."</p>

<p>"We won't discuss the matter any further
please, Jack," Frank protested, speaking
gently, but with a decision which Jack
recognized as having a serious intention back
of it.</p>

<p>Instantly she went to him and put her
hands on his shoulders, looking directly into
his blue eyes with her clear, wide grey ones.</p>

<p>"Tell me your reason please, Frank. This
isn't like you. You can't mean to be so
selfish&mdash;even so cruel."</p>

<p>Frank's eyes held his wife's, but he showed
no sign, either of flinching or yielding.</p>

<p>"I am sorry to have to say this to you, dear.
I wish you could have been willing to do what
I asked, without demanding my reason. But
I can't let my wife go to Bryan; I can't let
people think you and he care this much for
each other. People would talk&mdash;there would<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
be gossip. I am your husband and it is my
place to safeguard you. You and Bryan
never think of consequences&mdash;you are only
impetuous children."</p>

<p>"So you mean&mdash;" Jack let her hands drop
slowly from her husband's shoulders to her
own sides, "you mean, that because of a little
idle chatter&mdash;foolish, unkind gossip&mdash;oh, I
know some of the neighbors have already
talked of Bryan and me before this&mdash;you
would keep me from the friend we both care
so much for, at a time like this? I can't
believe it of you, Frank."</p>

<p>"Then I am sorry to disappoint you,
because I do mean it, Jack, dear. I suppose
it does seem narrow and worldly to you, with
your wider ideas of freedom and loyalty.
But hard as this may be for us both, you must
abide by my decision."</p>

<p>For another moment Jack remained silent,
her face flooding first with color and then the
color receding until she was curiously pale, so
that the darkness of her lashes showed
shadows on her white cheeks.</p>

<p>"I am sorry, Frank," she answered quietly,
"but in this matter I can not accept your
decision. I am a woman&mdash;not a child&mdash;and
this is a matter for my conscience as well as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
yours. Even if I am wrong, whatever consequences
I must suffer from your failing ever to
see this as I do, I must go to Bryan if he is
still alive."</p>

<p>Then Jack went quickly into her own room
again.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>A SURPRISE<br /><br /><br /></div>


<div class='cap'>DURING the night Frank decided that
he would not argue with Jack again
the question which was troubling
them both, since it was too painful for
discussion.</div>

<p>However, he did not sleep much, although
not once did his conviction that he was doing
the right thing waver. Frank had the belief
in his own judgment which comes to certain
people with authority. Also, he disliked
to suggest to his wife any of the little, ugly,
suspicious things of life, which he knew her
fine, clean nature would not consider. But
all the more for this reason did he believe that
he should protect her, even against herself.</p>

<p>Therefore, at breakfast the next morning,
Frank made no reference to Jack's final defiance
the night before. Not for an instant
did he think that she had meant anything,
except to have him appreciate how utterly her
point of view and her inclination differed from
his. This he accepted, realizing that he really<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
could not, under the circumstances, expect
anything else. But that Jack would ignore
his wish&mdash;even his expressed command&mdash;was
beyond his comprehension. She had always
been perfectly reasonable and amenable, and
there was nothing to serve him as a warning.</p>

<p>"I'll let you know as soon as I hear from
the war office," Frank remarked, as he left
for London.</p>

<p>Jack simply nodded quietly in response
without replying. As a matter of fact she,
too, had made up her mind in the night not to
reopen the subject upon which she and Frank
were so completely at variance.</p>

<p>Perhaps Jack was wrong in this and in the
whole proceeding which followed. Except
to say that she had the right to use her own
judgment&mdash;she never attempted to justify
herself.</p>

<p>As soon as she had arranged her household
matters and had seen her children, she went
into her private sitting room and, by using her
telephone for an hour or more, secured the
information which she desired.</p>

<p>She was able to locate Captain MacDonnell
and also to learn that he was still alive.
Moreover, Frank telegraphed this same fact
while she was still at the telephone.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span></p>

<p>Then Jack sent word for Olive and Frieda
to come to her bedroom, and when they
arrived she carefully closed the door.</p>

<p>They found her packing a small bag.</p>

<p>"What is it, Jack? Are you going up to
London to join Frank?" Frieda inquired, she
and Olive having been told nothing of the
contents of Captain MacDonnell's letter, nor
that there was such a letter in existence.</p>

<p>Jack had taken off her morning dress and
put on a light flannel wrapper of pale grey
with a white collar, as she wished to proceed
with her packing more readily.</p>

<p>At Frieda's question she shook her head
quietly and sat down in a big chair for a
moment, asking Olive and Frieda also to be
seated.</p>

<p>"No; I am not going to Frank," she
explained, "indeed, although I am forced to go
up to London, I don't want him to know I
am there, nor where he can find me for the
next day or so. Afterwards I will, of course,
write to him."</p>

<p>Seeing that Olive and Frieda were becoming
more mystified than enlightened by her
explanation, and that she was in reality
talking more to herself than to them, Jack
hesitated for a moment.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span></p>

<p>"Perhaps you won't approve what I am
planning to do any more than Frank does,"
Jack continued, "but Captain MacDonnell
has written to ask that I come to him in
France where he may be dying, and I am
going. Frank has said I must not, but I am
going anyway. I told him so last night, but
I don't believe he understood I really meant
what I said."</p>

<p>Jack spoke without any nervousness or
sentimental excitement. She looked unhappy,
but she also looked perfectly determined.</p>

<p>A little too surprised to answer at once,
Frieda again studied her sister's face closely.</p>

<p>It was Olive who protested.</p>

<p>"I hope you won't be angry with me, Jack,
and of course I cannot hope to influence you
if Frank cannot; but I don't think you ought
to do so serious a thing without Frank's consent.
In any case, please don't go away
without his knowing. You must know that
this is not right and that Frank will probably
be very hurt and angry."</p>

<p>Jack bit her lip for an instant without
replying; then she said slowly, as if she fully
weighed each word she uttered:</p>

<p>"Of course I realize you are right, Olive,
and I am afraid Frank will be both the things<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
you say, and more than you may realize.
I know, also, that I ought to see him again
and tell him definitely just what I intend to
do and why I intend doing it. But candidly,
if I do, I fear that Frank will not permit it.
He is not an American husband, and in any
event there would be a scene between us.
Frank would not understand at first that
this time I intend to keep to my determination.
We might quarrel and I don't wish that. It
would make me even more unhappy and not
save me in any way from Frank's displeasure."</p>

<p>"But, Jack, why do you think it is more
important to do what Captain MacDonnell
desires of you than what Frank wishes?"
Frieda inquired, in the cool, matter of fact
voice with which she usually, to other people's
surprise, asked the leading question.</p>

<p>Jack did not change color. She returned
her sister's look with her old clear, straightforward
gaze.</p>

<p>"I am glad you asked me that, Frieda,
dear," she responded, "because I don't want
you or anybody else to think that is true.
Nothing is so important to me as what
Frank wishes, only this time I think he is
making a great mistake, and is not being fair.
Of course he does not intend this, and is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
thinking of me more than of any one else, but
at the same time this is not a matter which I
think Frank can decide for me. His judgment
may be right from his point of view, but it
isn't from mine. I have to do what I think
is the fair thing, with the hope that I may be
able to persuade Frank to see it the same way
later on."</p>

<p>Olive made no response, but it was self evident
that Jack had not convinced her.</p>

<p>Frieda, however, got up in her fluffy morning
house gown and making a soft little rush
forward, threw her arms about her sister's
neck.</p>

<p>"Go ahead, Jack, then, and no matter what
happens I'll stand by you and swear you've
done the right thing to the bitter end. You
have been more right than other people as long
as I've known you. I would not pay any attention
to Olive. I told you that Olive
was getting to be an old maid and that old
maids always take the men's side. Only you
are not being rash, Jack, are you, so you
won't have to suffer uncomfortable consequences
afterwards?" Frieda concluded with
a slightly plaintive and mysterious manner.</p>

<p>"You'll look after my babies for me, won't
you, Olive? And Frieda, won't you try and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
get Frank into a good humor with me before
I come back? I shall be gone only a few
days; perhaps Bryan won't need me at all
when I arrive. I am going up to London
within two hours, but I'll get away from there
as soon as I can and take the first channel
boat possible. I must finish packing, but I'll
see you again before I start."</p>

<p>As Jack's words and manner were both
final, Olive and Frieda then left her. However,
they did not separate but went together
into Frieda's sitting-room.</p>

<p>There Frieda's expression grew as grave
as Olive's.</p>

<p>"Somehow I wish Jack wouldn't. Maybe
at the last moment she'll see Frank and
change her mind," Frieda suggested, staring
out at the winter landscape with her small
nose pressed mournfully against the window
pane like a discontented child. "I don't
understand Frank's disposition very well.
He is so different from Henry. Then he
has changed a great deal. We never thought
of his being autocratic when Jack married
him, but he seems rather that way to me
lately, though he is terribly nice and I am
fond of him. I wouldn't be, though, if he
was ever the least bit disagreeable to Jack.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
She is much too good for him or any other man.
Isn't it like her to go rushing off in this
quixotic fashion, knowing that lots of people
will misunderstand her, just because Captain
MacDonnell would like to feel her presence
beside him, if anything has to happen to him?
Well, I suppose that is exactly what I felt
when I rushed to her the moment I left
Henry? Only if Frank decides to be horrid
it would be unfortunate for us both to be
having trouble with our husbands at the
same time. I suppose people would say it
was because we did not have the proper
bringing up when we were children."</p>

<p>"Don't be absurd, Frieda," Olive answered
irritably. "Of course, Frank and Jack are
not going to have any serious difficulty. She
and Frank are quite different&mdash;"</p>

<p>Frieda swung her pretty self around.</p>

<p>"Don't you ever get tired of saying that
to me, Olive Van Mater? Of course Jack is
different, but I don't see that Frank is entirely
unlike other men. Oh, I know you'll be
shocked and angry at this and so would Frank
and Jack, if they ever heard; but just the
same I think Frank Kent is a little bit jealous
of Jack's friendship for Captain MacDonnell.
He would rather die than confess it to himself.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
I at least give him the credit for not knowing
it, but it's true just the same."</p>

<p>"I think that is very horrid of you, Frieda."</p>

<p>Frieda shrugged her shoulders.</p>

<p>"Yes, I thought you would think so. Still,
I do wish it was a whole week from today and
Jack was safely home again. I am frightened
about her taking such a trip alone; and as for
my attempting to get my brother-in-law
into a good humor after he learns that his
august Highness has been disobeyed&mdash;well,
the task is beyond my humble powers. In
any case, Olive, you can break the news of
Jack's departure to him."</p>

<p>But Jack spared both her sister and friend
this ordeal. Instead, she wrote a very sweet
letter to her husband, asking his pardon for
what she was doing and confessing that she
had no right not to have spoken of her intention
to him again. But would he see that she
must do what she believed to be right, and
that Bryan might not be able to wait while
they continued to argue the question?</p>

<p>She left the letter on Frank's bureau.</p>

<p>Not finding Jack in the library that evening,
where she usually awaited his return home,
Frank had gone directly upstairs, and when
she was also not in her room, he entered his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
apartment. The letter caught his attention
at once, but even then Lord Kent had no
faintest idea of what Jack's letter contained.
He supposed she had gone out on some errand
and had written to explain that she might be
late.</p>

<p>When he had finished reading, he quietly
tore her letter into small bits and flung the
pieces upon the fire.</p>

<p>Afterwards, going downstairs to dinner, he
said to Olive and Frieda.</p>

<p>"Jack has written me a note telling me that
she has gone to France. You both probably
know I did not wish her to go. Please let us
not speak of this matter again."</p>

<p>And though there was really nothing in
what Frank said, neither Olive nor Frieda
liked his expression or manner.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER XII</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>NO QUARTER<br /><br /><br /></div>


<div class='cap'>DURING the time of Jack's absence,
Frank Kent passed through a strange
state of mind, one which he did not
himself understand. He was both angry and
miserable. Resentment against another
human being is always folly, since one suffers
as much, if not more than the other person.</div>

<p>However, Frank did not answer a single one
of Jack's letters, although she managed to
write him several times, telling of her safe
arrival, of the kindness which had been
shown her along the way, and of Captain
MacDonnell's recognition of her and his
pleasure in finding an old friend near him.
Jack also wrote that there was hope of his
partial recovery, but that he would probably
be unable to fight again. She would be able
to tell more on her return home.</p>

<p>Two weeks after the day of her departure,
Jack came back to Kent House. She had
telegraphed when she reached British soil
so that her family knew when to expect her.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
Frank was not at home when she arrived, so
she saw her children and Olive and Frieda first.
Then, after dressing for dinner, she went
down into the library alone to wait for her
husband.</p>

<p>Jack was very tired from the strain of her
trip and from the sights she had witnessed
in the past fourteen days. She felt as if she
were entering a new world in coming back
tonight to her home in the peaceful Kentish
country. Whatever human beings might be
suffering inwardly, there were at least no
changes in the tranquillity of the blue hills
and the gentle, mist-veiled English landscape.</p>

<p>It had required an effort for Jack to dress,
but she did not know in what spirit Frank
would meet her and did not wish to have him
think she was too much exhausted by the
experience which she had wilfully chosen
for herself. She feared that Frank was still
aggrieved, because of his not having written
or sent her a message of any kind, and yet
she rather hoped the reunion with her and the
news she brought back would soften him.</p>

<p>Partly because of her fatigue, partly because
it seemed impossible to wear gay clothes after
those days and nights in the hospital, Jack
had put on a black satin gown which she had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
had some time. It was made simply as her
evening clothes always were, but the black
tulle which covered it was caught with jet
ornaments on each shoulder and loosely
belted in at the waist, falling in beautiful
lines to her feet. At her belt Jack wore a
golden rose which the old gardener had
brought up to the house as a special offering.
The rose had bloomed that morning in one of
the greenhouses. Jack's hair was coiled
closely about her small head, and she had
less color than usual.</p>

<p>She was resting in one of the big library
chairs with her eyes closed, when she heard
her husband enter the hall, and after making
some inquiry, move toward the library door.</p>

<p>At this she rose up at once and ran forward
with her arms outstretched to meet him, her
face glowing with happiness.</p>

<p>"Oh, Frank, I am so glad to be at home
again. It has all been so distressing. Poor
Bryan is going to get well, but I fear he will
hate it when he does, for he may never walk
again. He does not know this yet."</p>

<p>Frank turned his eyes so that he could not
see Jack's beauty nor appreciate her warm
sweetness so close beside him.</p>

<p>"I am horribly sorry for Bryan," he replied.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
But he made no effort to kiss Jack or to
express the least pleasure in her return.
Instead, he walked away a few steps and
began taking off his overcoat, which he had
not removed before.</p>

<p>"You are still angry with me, Frank?"
Jack queried, though the question was
scarcely a necessary one. "You have not
yet seen that I had the right to judge for
myself in this thing about Bryan? After all,
what possible wrong have I done? And I
did give Bryan pleasure; he does not dream,
of course, that I went to him without your
consent."</p>

<p>Although Frank still remained silent, Jack's
sweetness did not desert her. She followed
after him, in spite of the fact that he had
turned his back upon her.</p>

<p>"After all, Frank, even if you do continue
to disapprove of me and to think I did wrong
to disobey you, won't you make friends with
me? Please say I'm forgiven?"</p>

<p>At this Jack smiled and stood with her
hands clasped together against the soft,
black folds of her dress.</p>

<p>In fact, she had not yet appreciated the
extent of Frank's anger against her, nor the
unbending quality of his nature. Though<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
they had been married a number of years,
this was the first serious difficulty between
them. Jack had too great an admiration for
her husband, too deep a belief in him, to think
that he could continue to sulk and to hurt her
through a kind of stupid obstinacy.</p>

<p>And for a single instant Frank did hesitate,
but the next he made up his mind that unless
Jack was made to realize the extent of his
displeasure she would probably never yield
to him again. He honestly believed that he
had the right to be the master in his own
family.</p>

<p>"I presume, Jack, that you consider it a
very simple matter for me to say I forgive
you and to overlook your utter disregard of
my wishes, and your deception in the matter.
But I cannot see the thing in that light. You
have not only wounded me, but you have
made me ridiculous. To say I forgive you,
or feel as I did before would not be the
truth."</p>

<p>"Very well, Frank," Jack answered quietly
and went out of the room.</p>

<p>A little later she came down to dinner,
revealing no sign of what had taken place
between herself and her husband and hoping
that Frieda and Olive would not guess that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
she was still unforgiven. Frank's manner
was perfectly polite and they talked freely of
Captain MacDonnell and of the tragedy of
his recovering only to find his work as a
soldier ended.</p>

<p>Afterwards, Jack excused herself early in the
evening, because, of course, she had every
reason to feel weary.</p>

<p>But even if Frieda and Olive did not grasp
the situation at once, they could not continue
to remain long in ignorance, for Jack and
Frank did not return to their old intimacy and
devotion.</p>

<p>But, as the days went on, this was, perhaps,
as much Jack's fault as her husband's.</p>

<p>Never before had she ever made an overture
to any human being who had not responded.
Moreover, she could not tell Frank that she
was sorry for what she had done, for she was
not sorry, nor did she regret her own action.
She was merely disillusioned concerning her
husband.</p>

<p>Always Jack had said that she had more of
the Indian in her than Olive ever had, in
spite of Olive's upbringing. By this she
meant that for one thing she could hide
better the things that hurt her. Yet in a
way she was difficult for anyone to approach<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
on an intimate subject at this time, certainly
neither Olive nor Frieda made any mention
that they saw her continuing trouble with
Frank.</p>

<p>Unconsciously Jack held her head up before
people unfailingly. No outsider would have
guessed at any change. Only those who
cared for her deeply realized how she was
hurt by Frank's attitude.</p>

<p>Several times it occurred to Frank that
perhaps he and Jack were making a mistake
to allow their estrangement to go on too long.
The next time his wife asked his pardon
Lord Kent had concluded to forgive her.</p>

<p>Moreover, he and Frieda had an interview
which annoyed and amused him, but which
he did not forget then, or ever afterwards.</p>

<p>It was one Sunday afternoon in early March,
an unexpected spring-like day, and he and
Frieda were taking a motor ride together.
They had only one small car on the estate,
having sent the large one to be turned into an
ambulance.</p>

<p>After their midday dinner Frank had found
himself in need of diversion, Olive and Jack
having explained that they were going to see
a friend who was ill. And as a matter of fact
Frieda diverted Frank from serious affairs<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
more than any other grown up person he
knew and consequently he fell in readily with
her suggestion for the ride. He had not the
faintest idea that she was not in a friendly
mood toward him, for Frieda had wisely concealed
the fact, although in reality she was
thoroughly enraged.</p>

<p>It seemed to her that Frank's treatment of
Jack was almost unpardonable. It is true
that she, perhaps, had rather an exaggerated
opinion of her sister's virtues, but then Jack
had been a kind of mother to her always.
Although they quarreled a little now and
then, as most sisters do, it was beyond Frieda's
comprehension that anyone could believe Jack
would wilfully do wrong, or be forced to suffer
the consequences. Moreover, what Frieda still
thought of as her own "misfortune" made her
particularly "touchy" at present.</p>

<p>However, she and Frank started off cheerfully,
Frank admiring an especially pretty
bright blue motor coat and small close fitting
blue silk hat, which Frieda had purchased in
New York a few days before sailing. Nevertheless
Frieda had already planned to have a
talk with Frank before their return and only
awaited the proper opportunity.</p>

<p>She was quiet at first, allowing her brother-in-law<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
to tell her stories about the country and
his neighbors, stories in which she was really
not much interested. But Frieda smiled
and answered, "yes and no," at the proper
times, and this was what Frank really wished.
Most men would rather talk intimately to
women than to other men and Frank had
missed his long hours of conversation with
Jack more than he appreciated.</p>

<p>Yet Frieda's inattention finally forced itself
upon his notice, so that her brother-in-law
turned and smiled at her.</p>

<p>"What are you thinking about, Frieda?
Certainly not of what I just said to you."</p>

<p>Frieda turned her large blue eyes with their
heavy golden lashes half veiling them toward
her companion.</p>

<p>"Still I was thinking of you, Frank," she
answered, smiling, "and that is the attention
men like best, isn't it?"</p>

<p>Lord Kent laughed. "Perhaps as a matter
of vanity, yes, Frieda? But of course a good
deal depends upon what one is thinking.
What were you thinking of me?"</p>

<p>"Oh, only how unlike you and Henry are,"
she replied sweetly.</p>

<p>However, Frank understood something of
her hidden meaning, for he flushed.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, considering the fact that you didn't
find it possible to continue to live with
'Henry,' I suppose I ought to be flattered.
Only as a matter of fact, Frieda, I admire
Professor Russell very much."</p>

<p>This time Frieda flushed, realizing that
Frank had scored.</p>

<p>"Yet even though that is true, Frank,
Henry never took the tone with me of insisting
that he was always right and I was always
in the wrong. Do you know, Frank, I am
beginning to think&mdash;oh well, Henry was never
so horrid to me as you are to Jack. He isn't a
bit of a bully."</p>

<p>"So you think I am 'horrid' to Jack and a
bully besides, do you, Frieda?" Frank
returned grimly. He was angry, but not as
angry as he felt he had the right to be. Somehow
he could not manage to get into a violent
state of mind with his youthful sister-in-law.</p>

<p>Frieda nodded energetically in response,
without appearing the least bit frightened.</p>

<p>"Of course you are going to think I am
interfering, Frank, and no one <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'every'">ever</ins> pays any
real attention to what I say, but I just thought
I'd tell you anyhow. You are making a big
mistake. Of course I realize that you are not
so silly as not to appreciate Jack, but I don't<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
believe you have ever thought what it might
mean to lose her. You see she isn't like most
women, she really does not know how to
quarrel for any length of time. But when
she was hurt or seriously angry as a girl she
used to keep still for a long time not saying
a word. Then she used to do something
unexpected." Frieda's voice shook a little
with stronger feeling than she often showed.</p>

<p>"I've been afraid lately that Jack might do
something queer now, something no one of us
dreams she would think of doing. She is
so very unhappy. You remember, Frank,
don't you, what a long time it took you to win
Jack? I wonder if it might not take you even
longer to win her back again!"</p>

<p>Frank stiffened. "I cannot discuss my
relations with Jack, even with you, Frieda.
That is a matter between us alone."</p>

<p>Frieda nodded pensively.</p>

<p>"Certainly I appreciate your point of view,
Frank, from my own sad experience."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>THE BREAK<br /><br /><br /></div>


<div class='cap'>BUT Frank did give careful consideration
to what Frieda had said to him. Her
words came as a kind of revelation.
Suddenly he began to appreciate what it
would mean to lose Jack, though of course
there was no possibility of such a thing.
She was one of the most loyal persons in the
world and they had only had a difference of
opinion.</div>

<p>Yet Frank decided that it would be best to
let bygones be bygones and to mention the
fact to Jack at the first possible opportunity.</p>

<p>But somehow he seemed to have to wait
for the opportunity to arrive; certainly his
wife did nothing to help him.</p>

<p>One night, coming home at the usual hour,
Frank discovered that Jack was not there.
She had gone out a little before lunch on some
errand, as Olive and Frieda supposed, but
leaving no word except that they were not to
wait luncheon for her.</p>

<p>Frieda and Olive, Frank found, were both a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
little uneasy. He laughed at the idea. Jack
had a great many things to attend to in the
neighborhood and knew everybody, while
everybody knew her.</p>

<p>Afterwards, he went upstairs to the nursery
and stayed half an hour watching Vive and
Jimmie being put to bed. When he came
down to the library to read, twilight was
falling. But instead of reading Frank found
himself turning over the pages of the magazines,
gazing at them, and not knowing a
word of their contents.</p>

<p>In a few moments it would be dinner time.</p>

<p>He got up and walked nervously up and
down the room.</p>

<p>If Jack did not come in by dinner or send a
message what would it be wise to do?</p>

<p>A few moments later he telephoned two or
three places where he thought Jack might
have remained later than she realized. But
she had not been at any one of the houses
during the day, and naturally Frank did not
wish to ask too many questions, since she
might return home at any moment. It would
then appear absurd to have started false
rumors, or to have created anxiety among
their friends.</p>

<p>When the butler came in to announce dinner,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
Lord Kent explained that Lady Kent was not
yet at home and that dinner be kept waiting
for another half an hour.</p>

<p>Soon after Frieda joined him.</p>

<p>"I know I am silly, Frank," she confessed,
"but I am worried. If Jack had gone out on
horseback, one might understand that she
could have gotten some distance away. But
she did not ride, she walked, and could not
have continued walking since before noon."</p>

<p>"You are an infant, Frieda," Frank
remarked. "Of course Jack has been paying
visits and has stayed too long. But perhaps
I had best go and look for her, unless she has
found a friend to act as an escort it is too late
for her to be out alone."</p>

<p>"But where are you going to look?" Frieda
questioned. And either her brother-in-law
did not hear her, or preferred to pretend he
did not, since he made no reply.</p>

<p>The fact of the matter was he had no plan.
He thought it was rather absurd for him to
look at all, but had suddenly been overtaken
with a sense of uneasiness, a strange
foreboding of disaster. We all yield to these
sensations now and then, but as they were
not usual with Lord Kent he was the more
uncomfortable.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span></p>

<p>He could not even decide whether it would
be wiser for him to ride or to walk, but concluded
he had best ride, in order to cover a
greater distance in a shorter time.</p>

<p>He searched very carefully for Jack down
the long road which divided the estate. And
naturally he remembered the other evening,
not so very many months ago, when he had
ridden down this same avenue peering through
the rain for her and Captain MacDonnell.
Then he had discovered both of them with
but little difficulty.</p>

<p>Tonight Frank wished that he felt sure
Jack had someone with her to take care of
her, as she had on that other evening. He
would not then have felt so ridiculously
worried.</p>

<p>"Poor Bryan, one did not like to allow
oneself to think of him too often these days,
yet he must be brought back home as soon
as possible," Frank thought. Some time ago
he had decided that when the time came he
would himself go for Bryan. Perhaps this
would be partly an act of expiation, although
Lord Kent had not said this to himself, or to
his wife.</p>

<p>This evening he rode directly into the
village, but although it was only a little after<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
eight o'clock, Granchester had long practiced
the daylight saving habit, not because of the
war, but because of a fixed habit of early
sleep and early rising. There were only two
or three scattered lights in the little stone
houses and only a few old men outdoors
talking together in front of a closed public
house.</p>

<p>Nevertheless Frank rode up to the home of
Frieda's old friend and dismounted, for he
had known Mrs. Huggins many long years.
She was accepted by everybody as a kind of
unprinted village newspaper. If Jack had
been in Granchester during the afternoon,
Mrs. Huggins would know just where she
had been and what she had done.</p>

<p>The old woman's light was out, but a
moment after his knocking she opened her
door. In her hand she held a lamp and her
old eyes shone through the half darkness.</p>

<p>She was probably excited by the idea that
someone had come to confide a piece of news
to her.</p>

<p>However, she had heard nothing of Lady
Kent's having been in the village during the
day, and was in fact sure she had not been
there.</p>

<p>When Lord Kent went away, however,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
she still seemed to think he had brought her
news.</p>

<p>"There is trouble in the big house, also,"
she said to herself, wagging her old head.
"Funny how when trouble of one kind gets
loosed in the world, so many other kinds
follow it." Even after she had gone back to
bed she still kept thinking of Kent House.</p>

<p>Later, just before he was leaving Granchester,
Frank telephoned to his home.</p>

<p>Frieda came to the telephone to say that no
word had yet come from her sister.</p>

<p>Nevertheless Lord Kent could not make
up his mind to ask for aid in his search.
He had a curious antipathy toward it, as if
Jack herself would not like this, as if in some
way it might lead to a revelation they would
not wish others to share.</p>

<p>This was what made all his efforts so difficult.
For each added moment he was
becoming more and more worried, and yet
having to pretend that Jack's failure to return
home, her failure to send any word of her
whereabouts, was the most casual thing in the
world.</p>

<p>There were several places belonging to
friends and not far from the village. Lord
Kent stopped by at each place for a few<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
moments, as if he were making an ordinary
visit, but of course to find out if Jack had
called during the day. Apparently no one
of her friends had seen her.</p>

<p>At Captain MacDonnell's home, Frank
inquired for the housekeeper. Mrs. Naxie
was still in charge and she and Frank were old
friends. She had been with Captain MacDonnell's
uncle years before when he and
Bryan were both little boys.</p>

<p>Lord Kent was not ashamed to reveal his
anxiety to Mrs. Naxie, and she at least had a
little information for him, the first he had
secured.</p>

<p>"Yes, Lady Kent had stopped by a little
before tea time and had seemed tired. She
explained that she had eaten no lunch, but
enjoyed her tea, and then started away
again. Mrs. Naxie was under the impression
she intended going directly home.</p>

<p>"There was nothing more for him to do but
to go home also," Frank then concluded.
If Jack had not returned and nothing was
known of her, he must throw away his
scruples and ask for help.</p>

<p>It was now fully night and the sky filled
with high, sweet stars.</p>

<p>Although he yearned to be at home at once,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
still Frank searched all the roads, stared
behind the tall hedges, and now and then in
the darkness called his wife's name. Nevertheless
he continued to assure himself that
he was behaving like a fool and there was no
real reason for him to feel so alarmed. He
had always been ridiculously nervous about
Jack and always before now she had laughed
at him.</p>

<p>It was not until he had almost reached the
beginning of his own land that Frank was
finally honest with himself. He had fought
against confessing the fact that he was to
blame every moment since he first began to
grow uneasy about Jack. Had they been
good friends these past few weeks he knew he
would not have been half so miserable.
Whether he had been right or wrong, he had
realized that Jack had been anxious to make
peace and he had repulsed her. He would
wait for no comfortable opportunity now, as
soon as he found his wife, they must be
reconciled.</p>

<p>Near the edge of Kent Park, where the land
dipped, there was a small stream, deep in
some places, and yet hardly to be dignified by
the title of river.</p>

<p>Yielding to an impulse Frank got off his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
horse here and walked slowly along the bank.
The stream was so narrow he could see
almost equally well on the farther side.</p>

<p>The trees and underbrush made shadows on
the surface where the water was deepest.</p>

<p>Suddenly Frank thought he saw one of the
slender, young birches move a step toward
him. The next he heard Jack's voice say:</p>

<p>"Frank, is that you?"</p>

<p>Then she came slowly toward him.</p>

<p>The strange fact was that she did not
appear surprised, nor did she begin by offering
any explanation of her own strange behavior,
nor why she should be found at such an hour
in such a place.</p>

<p>"Sit down for a little while will you please,
Frank? The ground is not particularly damp
in some places, I have been sitting here a
long time."</p>

<p>Frank made no reply except to do what she
liked. He knew that something had happened
which was of tremendous seriousness to Jack.
If that were true, then whatever it was, was
equally so to him.</p>

<p>"You are not ill, are you, dear?" he inquired,
after he had let go his bridle and taken a
seat beside his wife. His horse would only
wander about near by.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span></p>

<p>Jack shook her head.</p>

<p>"I was dizzy and very tired a little while
ago, I don't know just how long. I sat down
here to rest and fell asleep for a time. I am
quite all right now." And indeed Jack was
now speaking in a natural voice. One must
remember it was not so unusual for her, as it
would be with most other girls and women,
to take her problems outdoors when she
wished to solve them.</p>

<p>"There is something I want to say to you,
Frank. I have been making up my mind to
speak of it for some time. This afternoon
I knew I had to decide. I went off for a long
walk and now I have decided."</p>

<p>Jack was sitting very still a few feet away
from her husband. He now moved over and
put his arm about her, but though she made
no movement to resent it, she showed no sign
of pleasure or of yielding.</p>

<p>"I want to go home, Frank?" she continued.</p>

<p>And for an instant believing she meant
Kent House, Frank started to rise. The
next he understood his mistake.</p>

<p>"I mean I want to go back to the Rainbow
ranch to see Jim and Ruth and Jean, but
Jim most of all," she added, this time with a
little break in her usually steady voice.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span></p>

<p>"Please don't answer, Frank, until I have
explained to you a little better. I know it
seems horrid to leave you alone and to take
the babies away, when you are so worn out
with your work and so sad over all the
wretched tragedy of the war. You will miss
the babies, even if you will not particularly
miss me. Still I'll have to go, Frank. I
can't live on with you not forgiving, not caring
for me any more. I won't stay long unless
you wish it and I'll come back whenever you
send for me. But I must go; it has seemed to
me lately as if I could not breathe."</p>

<p>Jack turned her face directly to her husband,
and although it was too dark to see it distinctly,
he could catch the dim outline.</p>

<p>"You see until lately I never dreamed that
when things came to a crisis, to a question of
right, to a question of my judgment, or my
conscience, you would not be willing to let
me do as I decided and thought best. I knew
you liked me to follow your way in little
things and I never minded most times. Often
I was glad to do as you wished and when I
didn't agree to your way, I never considered
the fact seriously one way or the other. But
lately I have seen that if we go on living
together, I have got to be a coward, a kind of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
traitor to myself by always appearing to agree
with you, or else live with you and have you
angry and dissatisfied with me. I cannot
bear either. Marriage does not mean that
to me, Frank. I have to get away for a little
while to see if I can find out what I should do."</p>

<p>There was no sign of anger in Jack's manner,
if she had been feeling angry lately, and of
course she had being perfectly human, her
anger had disappeared tonight during the long
hours she had been thinking things out alone.</p>

<p>Sitting beside his wife, suddenly as she
finished speaking Frank recalled something
Frieda had lately said to him. Perhaps Frieda
had more brains than her family and friends
realized. However, what she had said was
that whenever she was angry or wounded,
her sister Jack was apt to go off to herself
and then do something unexpected.</p>

<p>Surely his wife's request tonight was wholly
unexpected.</p>

<p>But Frank only answered, not revealing
what he felt, nor what he intended.</p>

<p>"I think this is a pretty severe punishment,
Jack, if you think I am unfair. But you must
let me take you home to Kent House now;
Olive and Frieda are both dreadfully worried
to know what has become of you."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>PROFESSOR AND PROFESSORESS<br /><br /><br /></div>


<div class='cap'>WHEN it was finally decided that
Jack was to go home to the Rainbow
ranch with her babies and Olive and
Frieda for a visit, Frieda strenuously objected.
No reason was given her by her sister except
the ordinary one, that Jack wished to get
away from the sad atmosphere of a country
at war and also to see her family.</div>

<p>"Certainly you don't show much consideration
for Frank," Frieda protested when she
first heard the news. "It seems to me that
England is <i>his</i> country and he has a good deal
more work to do and goes through a lot more
than you do, Jacqueline Ralston. I never
could make up my mind to leave my husband
under such circumstances."</p>

<p>Then although Jack flinched, she did not
make the reply she might so obviously have
made.</p>

<p>However, Frieda went on just as if she had.</p>

<p>"I know what you are thinking of, but it
was quite different with Henry and me. He<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
did not need me, he thought I was a butterfly
and my wishing to go out and dance and do
exciting things disturbed his work. He didn't
allow me to go with other people because he
thought it was his <i>duty</i> to look after me.
He said so, said I was too young to be expected
to take care of myself. He wasn't a bit
jealous like Frank, I shouldn't have minded a
jealous husband. If I said he was jealous, I
was only pretending because I wanted to
seem interesting."</p>

<p>"Frank jealous?" Jack laughed. "You
are too silly, Frieda."</p>

<p>Nevertheless Frieda tossed her yellow head,
but also flushed a little, having said more
than she intended. If Frank did not know
he was jealous of Captain MacDonnell and
Jack was also unaware how much this had
unconsciously influenced his decision concerning
his friend's request, it was not her place
to tell them.</p>

<p>"Just the same you'll be sorry and ashamed
of yourself some day, Jack Ralston. You
need not pretend anything to me, I understand
the present situation perfectly. Frank
was rather horrid to you and he ought not to
be allowed to be a bully, but you could really
twist him around your finger if you tried. You<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
can now at any rate because he adores you.
And Frank is pretty nice you know, most
women would be glad to have him. After all
he has a title and money, and men are going
to be scarce when this war is over."</p>

<p>"Frieda!" Jack exclaimed in such a tone
of disgust that Frieda departed hastily, if still
gracefully, out of her sister's room.</p>

<p>However she stopped at the door.</p>

<p>"You know it will look perfectly absurd for
us both to go back home without husbands,"
Frieda tossed out. "I didn't mind half so
much when Frank was around and there was
at least one man in our family. But of course
it looks now as if we had something the
matter with us, horrid dispositions, so that
no man could make up his mind to live with
us."</p>

<p>This time Jack betrayed herself a little more
by showing anger.</p>

<p>"You have no right to assume I am
behaving as you did, Frieda, because I want
to go to the old ranch for a time. Frank has
given me his consent, I've no idea of running
away."</p>

<p>Then, as Frieda burst into tears at the
allusion, Jack had to draw her small sister
back into her room from the doorway, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
do what she could to apologize and console
her.</p>

<p>She felt rather a hypocrite, too, because
after all Frieda was not so far wrong in some
of her suppositions, and she had had no right
to pretend to superiority.</p>

<p>There was at this time no danger to passenger
vessels through submarines, so that it was
arranged for the travelers to leave for the
United States early in April that they might
spend the spring at the Rainbow Ranch.</p>

<p>Olive was anxious to go. She had not
intended remaining in England so long, and
wished to take up some course of study at
home, to return later when she might make
herself more useful.</p>

<p>Jack was torn between her desire to make a
visit to her own home, to get away for a
breath of freedom and the chance to decide
what she ought to do in the future when
Frank opposed her right to decide important
issues for herself and the thought that, perhaps,
Frieda was right and that she was not playing
fair in leaving her husband at so trying a time.
But Frank had not opposed her going, had
really said he thought it might be a good
thing, and she did not know whether he meant
this from her standpoint or from his own.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
It might be that Frank also would enjoy a
certain relief from the presence of a wife who
would not trust his judgment. Certainly
Frank's affection had never seemed the same
since that time. He had been wonderfully good
in agreeing to her new wish, but there were
moments when, womanlike, Jack wondered
if she would not have liked it better had he
shown more opposition.</p>

<p>So there was only Frieda who unqualifiedly
stormed against leaving. Of course she put
it all on disapproving of her sister's action,
but naturally her family wondered if the
fact that Frieda wished to be near her husband,
whom she believed to be fighting in
France could have anything to do with her
point of view. However, no one dared to
make this suggestion to her. It would have
done no good in any case since she would
probably have promptly denied it.</p>

<p>However, Frieda would not remain in
England without her sister and Jack was
unwilling that she should. Nevertheless,
insisting on maintaining the attitude of an
aggrieved character, Frieda separated herself
from her own family whenever she could.</p>

<p>Twice a week for instance she went into
Granchester to tea with Mrs. Huggins.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
Frieda had a private reason for this. One day
she had overlooked the fact that her own
"Dame Quick" had not been her nurse or
foster mother and had confided to the old
woman some of the things which were troubling
her. She did not want advice, what she
wanted was to say those things aloud which
she had been saying to herself, and she knew
her old friend would simply listen and be kind
to her. One might think she would have
feared that the old woman, with her passion
for spreading news, would have gossiped about
her, but Frieda knew better than this.</p>

<p>One afternoon, about ten days before their
sailing time, Frieda started off alone to walk
to Granchester. She was earlier than need
be since Olive had asked her a question which
had offended her and she had been irritable.
She thought she had caught the suggestion of a
lecture in her sister's expression and so had
hurried off before Jack had a chance to speak.</p>

<p>Frieda recognized the fact that she was a
little difficult to live with these days. But
then she excused herself by saying that no
one knew how worried and nervous she was.
There were times when Frieda was afraid
she might be losing her prettiness through
worry, until her mirror reassured her. For<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
Frieda understood her own appearance, just
as she understood a great many things.
She knew that Jack had developed into a
beauty from a merely handsome girlhood and
that she was only pretty. But she also
realized that prettiness often makes more
appeal, especially to men, than a higher type
of loveliness. Therefore, Frieda had no idea
of not preserving her own charms as long
as she possibly could.</p>

<p>She walked slowly so as not to arrive too
early and because she was enjoying the
country more than she usually did. The
quietness of the English landscape, its look of
a carefully kept garden, appealed to Frieda
more than the vastness of her own windswept
western prairies. It was one of the many
odd ironies of fate that Jack, who loved the
prairies must live in England, while until
lately Frieda's life had been cast at least on the
edge of the western country.</p>

<p>The old English laborers passing back and
forth from their ploughing of the spring fields
were almost the only persons she met.</p>

<p>When Frieda reached the little house at the
edge of the village, of which Mrs. Huggins
had once told her some story, she stopped
for a moment without any particular motive.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span></p>

<p>She did not remember exactly what the story
was, if she had ever known. But the little
house rather interested her. For one thing
she had noticed every time she passed, at no
matter what hour, the blinds were always
drawn halfway down.</p>

<p>The house was set in the middle of a small
yard and had a little, low ivy covered stone
fence surrounding it and a wooden gate.
However, the front of the house was only a
few yards from the street so that one could see
it distinctly.</p>

<p>Frieda was not standing still, but was
loitering a few feet from the gate, gazing
absently toward the lower windows.</p>

<p>Then suddenly and certainly unexpectedly
she heard a strange noise, a kind of muffled
roar. Then an explosion burst forth so that
several panes of window glass broke and
puffs of smoke blew out.</p>

<p>For an instant there appeared back of the
window, and surrounded by the smoke like
a cherubim among clouds, a face which
Frieda did not really believe she saw. Yet
of course she knew she did see it, or else was
suddenly mad or dreaming.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact she had the sensation
that she was taking part in a ridiculous and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
improbable detective story, of the kind one
reads in the weekly magazines.</p>

<p>Yet without hesitating, or feeling the
proper amount of <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'uncertainity'">uncertainty</ins>, or fear, Frieda
jerked open the little wooden gate and rushed
up the path to the front door of the house.</p>

<p>There at least she did stop to give the bell
a fierce pull, but she might have rushed in
had she supposed the door unlocked.</p>

<p>However, the next second a little white faced
maid appeared at the door, and Frieda
simply swept by her. The door of the room,
where she had seen the apparition, was on
the left side of the hall and without knocking
she opened this. Just how Frieda would
have explained her own behavior had she
made a mistake did not trouble her.</p>

<p>But she had not made a mistake. There
standing in the centre of the room and still
somewhat surrounded by smoke and with
the blood coming from an injury to his hand,
stood the person whose face Frieda believed
she had seen through the broken window.
No, she did not really believe she had seen it,
though of course she knew she had.</p>


<p>"Are you a deserter, Henry, hiding from
justice?" Frieda demanded scathingly, and
still following the example of the method<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
employed in detective stories, since her experience
was so exactly of the same kind.</p>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/illus04.jpg" width="500" height="313" alt="I Assure You I Have Official Permission" title="" />
<span class="caption">I Assure You I Have Official Permission</span>
</div>

<p>"I most certainly am not, my dear," Professor
Russell answered firmly, but still somewhat
apologetically.</p>

<p>"I was slightly wounded soon after my
arrival at the front. But I also found that
my scientific knowledge could be of more
service than my abilities as a soldier. So I
came back to England and have been experimenting
with gas bombs with that in mind.
I assure you I have official permission."</p>

<p>"Then why have you been hiding and why
did you come down here?"</p>

<p>Professor Russell looked at Frieda and
smiled slowly.</p>

<p>"You are the answer to both those questions,
Frieda."</p>

<p>Unexpectedly Frieda's blue eyes filled with
tears.</p>

<p>"I don't see how you can say that, Henry,
when you have never even tried to see me, or
to let me know what had become of you.
You knew I was suffering horribly for fear you
might be hurt or dead or something and you
wouldn't write me."</p>

<p>Professor Russell's lips twitched at the
thought of his being blamed for not writing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
after the worst had happened to him. But
he made no other sign.</p>

<p>"You are mistaken, I have seen you, my
dear, many a time when you have passed this
window and at least I have had the satisfaction
of realizing you were well and happy."</p>

<p>"But I am neither," Frieda protested.
"Besides I don't understand how you knew,
unless, unless&mdash;do you mean Frank and Jack
were both aware that you were here and never
told me? They preferred I should suffer. I
shall never forgive either of them, never."
And Frieda drew herself up, very stately and
very injured. But in truth her lips were
trembling.</p>

<p>"You are not to blame your sister or brother,
Frieda," Professor Russell interrupted.
"They have simply done what I asked, what
I required of them. You came over to
England to be rid of my presence. I had
neither the desire nor the right to thrust
myself upon you."</p>

<p>"Then I don't see why you didn't go and
live somewhere else," Frieda remarked
petulantly. But at the same instant she
sank down into a chair.</p>

<p>"I do wish, Henry, you would give me some
tea. You seem to have an extraordinary<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
looking little girl to look after you. And I feel
very much overcome from the shock of hearing
an explosion outside a strange house and then
seeing your face floating in space on the
inside. Moreover, if you are so extraordinarily
scientific I should think you would know
enough to go and wash that gas bomb out of
your hand."</p>

<p>This time Professor Russell openly laughed.</p>

<p>"It is scarcely a gas bomb inside my hand,
Frieda. One of the chemicals simply went
slightly wrong."</p>

<p>But Frieda had closed her eyes and dropped
her head back and really looked so pale that
her husband hurried out after his small maid
and the tea things.</p>

<p>The moment he had disappeared however
she opened her eyes again.</p>

<p>"I am going to take Henry Russell back to
the United States with me in ten days," she
remarked aloud, but in a very small whisper.
"I don't know how I am going to manage him
or the British Government, but I am going to,
somehow. I thought I was bored with Henry
and I was and I'll probably be again. But I
suppose all women are bored with the men
they live with sometimes. Anyhow, I had to
think I had lost Henry to know I wanted to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
keep him. He does get a little upset now
and then when I want my own way all the
time, but really under the same circumstances
I don't suppose any other man would be half
so nice to me as Henry is. Besides, oh well,
I believe I'm pretty fond of him."</p>

<p>When Professor Russell returned, Frieda
again managed to have her eyes closed and
she really was upset by the events of the past
few moments, as was to be expected.</p>

<p>Therefore she seemed very languid while
Professor Russell and his little maid set out
the tea things. She did offer faintly to help,
observing that her husband had full use of
only one hand. But as it was his left hand
and he insisted on getting along alone, she
permitted it, even to the actually pouring
and handing her of the first cup of tea.</p>

<p>Later he took a seat in a chair opposite her.</p>

<p>The unfortunate thing with Frieda was that
she seldom could control her appetite, had
never been able to since her chocolate drop
days. So she concluded she had best begin
her plan of procedure early.</p>

<p>"I don't see how Jack and Frank could
have told you I was well, Henry," she said
plaintively. "I don't suppose you have
noticed but I have lost a good many pounds."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span></p>

<p>As a matter of fact Frieda had lost several
pounds, although she was still reasonably
rounded.</p>

<p>"No, I had not noticed before, but I observe
you have," the Professor returned. "I trust
there is nothing serious the matter. What is
the doctor's opinion?"</p>

<p>Frieda shook her head. "I have not seen
a doctor. Really, I have not spoken of this
to any one before, Henry. But do you know
I think, perhaps, I have not been well for a
good many months, even before I left Chicago.
Maybe that is what made me cross sometimes,
Henry. Maybe that's why I ran away
without telling you I was going. I really
think I ought to have talked the matter over
with you, Henry. You would have been quite
willing for me to make Jack a visit wouldn't
you, Henry, just as Frank is allowing Jack
to go home to the ranch?"</p>

<p>Frieda's hand holding the tea cup shook a
little.</p>

<p>"But I didn't know this was a visit, Frieda.
I thought you had gone away for good.
Indeed, I am under the impression that you
said you never wished to see me again."</p>

<p>Frieda shook her head.</p>

<p>"I never could have really said that,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
Henry, or if I did, you were silly to think I
meant it. I often say lots of things I don't
mean. And I have wanted to see you lots
lately."</p>

<p>Professor Russell took Frieda's cup away
and laid firm hold on both her hands.</p>

<p>"Look at me, Frieda," he ordered quietly,
"and don't answer me until you have thought
carefully about what you wish to reply.
You have been a child a long time, Frieda,
but my dear, you have to grow up. All of us
must sooner or later. I am a good deal older
than you and not only that but I care for a lot
of things which seem dull and uninteresting
to you. So do you care for things which do
not seem vital to me. But I'm willing to
confess I'm an old fogy and sometimes I
believe, Frieda dear, I did you a great wrong
when I married you at such a youthful age.
I want you to know, my dear, that I want to
do whatever is best for your happiness. I am
willing to go out of your life, to relieve you
of me altogether if in any way it can be managed
without reflection upon you."</p>

<p>"Then you mean you don't love me any
more, Henry, you can't forgive me for what I
did," Frieda gasped, turning really honestly pale
this time. Professor Russell shook his head.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span></p>

<p>"I don't mean any such thing, Frieda
child. Moreover, you know perfectly well that
I don't and that it is exceedingly reprehensible
for you to go on flirting in this way with your
own husband unless you also care for him."</p>

<p>Frieda sighed with satisfaction and lifted
up her face to her husband, plainly suggesting
by her expression what she expected him
to do.</p>

<p>The moment after, she said, with that
funny look of gravity which no one ever paid
any special attention to from her.</p>

<p>"Do you know, Henry, if you say things
like that to me oftener, I feel sure I will care
for you more. But please get your hat and
come with me now, I want to introduce you
to a very dear, old friend of mine in Granchester.
Afterwards, if your hand does not
hurt, you must go up to Kent House with me
to dinner. I intend to let Jack and Frank
know that I can manage my own affairs and
do not in the future intend to be kept in the
dark as if I were a silly child."</p>

<p>The Professor obeyed orders.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XV</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>THE OLD RANCH<br /><br /><br /></div>


<div class='cap'>IT was a wonderful May day when Frieda
and her Professor, Jack and her two
babies and nurse, and Olive arrived at the
Rainbow Ranch.</div>

<p>Jim and Ruth Colter and Jean Merritt,
who was their own Jean Bruce, of the old
Ranch Girl days, drove down to the same
funny little frame station to meet them.
But beside the automobile they brought a
great wagon, which Jim drove himself, in
order that they might take up to the house
as many trunks and as many people as could
not be stored away in the car.</p>

<p>Jack insisted on returning home alongside
Jim, seated on the driver's seat, her feet still
not quite touching the floor.</p>

<p>She had put her babies in the automobile,
with Ruth and Jean, so that they might make
each others' acquaintance. Moreover, she
had a sentiment in wishing to reach the old
ranch with Jim as her companion. No
matter what had happened to her, no matter<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
what should happen in the future, Jim, who was
her first friend, the manager of the old ranch,
and her own and Frieda's guardian, would remain
her best friend to the end of the chapter.</p>

<p>She knew, too, that Olive cherished many
happy memories, while Frieda was beatific
these days in the company of her Professor.</p>

<p>Jack felt a singing in her heart and in her
ears as she saw the wide meadows now
blossoming with purple clover and heard the
western larks rising high over the land,
dipping toward it again, then soaring higher
up, as if they threw aside the call of the earth
for the loftier one of the air.</p>

<p>Jim and Ruth with their children, and Jean
and Ralph Merritt and their little girl, when
they were at the ranch, lived in the great
house which the Ranch girls had built after
coming into their fortune through the discovery
of the mine on their place. But the
old Rainbow Lodge, where they had all lived
as little girls when it was rather hard to make
expenses in the dry seasons in Wyoming, had
never been torn down. Indeed, as a special
request from Jack it had been kept in perfect
repair and still remained simply and comfortably
furnished.</p>

<p>Whenever there were too many guests at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
the big house, some of them were sent down
here, and more often, when he could bear the
ways of high society no longer, Jim escaped
to the old lodge for a quiet smoke and perhaps
an hour to himself. Now and then Ruth, his
wife, would come to join him, and they would
talk of the early days at the ranch and their
first meeting, when Ruth was a prim New
England schoolmarm.</p>

<p>So, as a favor, Jack had asked that the old
Lodge be given over to her use while she was
at home. She and the babies would come up
to the big house for their meals, except at
night when the babies could be better taken
care of at the Lodge. This would give all the
more room for the others.</p>

<p>So, as Ruth, Jim and Jean, realized that
Jack sincerely wished this arrangement, they
had agreed with her desire. Jack had married
so soon after the building of the house, which
Frieda had named "The Rainbow Castle,"
that she had never learned to feel any particular
affection for it. So in coming home
she wished to return to the house she had
loved and remembered.</p>

<p>On either side <ins title="Transcriber's Note: this word not present in original text">of</ins> the old Lodge, Frieda's violet
beds were still carefully tended and today
were a mass of bloom.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span></p>

<p>Olive and Frieda and the Professor insisted
on getting out first at the Lodge with Jack
and Jim. When they entered the old living
room it was so like the one they recalled that
the three women, who were girls no longer,
felt a sudden catching of their breath.</p>

<p>But of course Jim and Jean had arranged
the old room to look as much like it formerly
did as possible. They had the Indian rugs on
the floor, the old shelves of books, with just
the books the Ranch girls had owned long
before, the great open fireplace and the tall
brass candlesticks on the mantel.</p>

<p>Then before leaving for the station Jean
had filled the room with bunches of violets,
as Frieda had once been accustomed to do.</p>

<p>"It is still just the loveliest, homiest place
in the world!" Frieda exclaimed.</p>

<p>Jack did not feel that she could speak for the
first minute, and the next Jean had come
running in carrying Vive in her arms and with
Jimmie beside her. They were followed by
Jean's own little daughter, Jacqueline, and by
two other little girls, who belonged to Jim
and Ruth and another Jimmie, who was
somewhere between the biggest and the
littlest Jim.</p>

<p>Then there was, of course, the immense confusion<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
of the arrival and the settling of so
large a number of guests. Besides there were
so many children to be looked after who
always must be considered first.</p>

<p>That evening there was a dinner at the big
house, at which everybody talked a great
deal, asked a great many questions and
answered them. But in reality they were all
too tired and excited to get much satisfaction
from one another.</p>

<p>Afterwards, although Jim and Jack walked
home alone to the Lodge, they did not try to
say a great deal to each other. Only at parting
Jim said, "Have a cup of coffee in the morning
early, Jack. I have promised Ruth not to
take you too far, but I've a new horse for you
to try and I want you to have the first ride
over the ranch with me, while the others are
still asleep. You and I are the only ones
who have <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'every'">ever</ins> really loved the dawn out
here in God's country. Ruth has left some
riding togs for you somewhere in your room."</p>

<p>Waking before six o'clock next morning,
Jack was lying in bed breathing deeply of the
sweet clover-scented air, when she heard a
never to be forgotten whistle outside her
window.</p>

<p>She stuck her head out.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span></p>

<p>"I'll be down in ten minutes, Jim. Is that
the horse for me? Isn't he a beauty? But
hitch yours and mine somewhere outside and
open the Lodge door, I didn't lock it last
night, and come in and start my coffee. I
just opened my eyes this minute."</p>

<p>Ten minutes later, as she had said, Jack slid
quietly downstairs so as not to arouse her
children. She smelt the delicious aroma of
the coffee in the old Lodge kitchen, once presided
over by old Aunt Ellen, who had died a
few years before. She also discovered Jim
helping himself to the first cup when she
appeared. But instead he gave it to her, got
another for himself and handed her a napkin
filled with sandwiches which Ruth had provided.
Then they drank and munched as
silently and contentedly as they always had
in each other's company during many years
and various experiences.</p>

<p>But they had both stepped out on the big
front porch of the Lodge, when Jim suddenly
swung round and put his hands on Jack's
slender shoulders.</p>

<p>He had seen something in her face which
the others had not, perhaps because he had
always cared for her most.</p>

<p>"Ain't anybody been doin' anything to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
you, you don't like, Boss?" Jim demanded,
purposely breaking into the old careless speech
he had used before Ruth's coming to Rainbow
Ranch to educate them all, and Jim more than
any one. "Because if anyone has, you know
you can always count on your old pardner."</p>

<p>But Jack only laughed and shook her head
rubbing it against his sleeve, as a young colt
does. This had been one of the things she
used to do as a girl, half as an expression of
affection and half to conceal her embarrassment.</p>

<p>Then Jack ran out to where her horse was
waiting. She had on a khaki riding costume,
a new one, but except for that, pretty much of
the same kind that she had been accustomed
to wearing as Jacqueline Ralston.</p>

<p>She was now looking over the horse
critically.</p>

<p>"He is one of the most perfect creatures I
ever saw, Jim. I don't care what other
people say, I like our fine western horses
better than any others in the world."</p>

<p>"Try him, Jack," and Jim lifted her lightly
up.</p>

<p>The next instant she had gone down the
avenue like a streak of light, whirled and
come back again.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span></p>

<p>"His movement seems perfect, too, but I'll
have to give him more of a test before I can
decide."</p>

<p>She then started off again with Jim Colter
beside her.</p>

<p>"If you like him, Jack, the horse is a
present from me. I got him and had him
broken for you. I don't ever want anyone
else to use him."</p>

<p>Jack's face flushed. "Jim, there never was
anybody so good to me as you have always
been, and no one who has ever understood
me so well. I don't mean that there is much
to understand, but what there is I know you
believe the best of."</p>

<p>"Well, I don't expect there is anybody who
began to know you as soon as I did, Jack,"
Jim Colter answered, realizing again that there
was something behind Jack's words which she
did not exactly wish to confide in him.</p>

<p>It was all very well for the rest of the family
to say Jack didn't look a day older. She was
better looking than she used to be, if that was
what they were talking about, and her figure
looked very slim and sweet and girlish, as she
rode there beside him, as gracefully and as
much at ease as ever. But Jack's expression
was different, there were shadows under her<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
eyes, no matter how her lips were smiling.
Jim remembered that even if he had liked
Frank Kent, he never had thought much of
Englishmen as husbands for American girls.</p>

<p>But he said nothing more on the subject to
Jack, only pointing out objects in the
familiar, old landscape which they both
loved, and realizing that if Jack had anything
to tell him she would do so of her own accord
later on.</p>

<p>They were late to breakfast, of course, so
they found that all the others, having finished,
were out on the lawn waiting.</p>

<p>"I suppose Jim tried to show you every
horse and every cow on the ranch, Jack,"
Ruth began. "I hope you are not worn out,
child. I told him to allow you one night's
rest."</p>

<p>Ruth Colter was growing very matronly
these days with her husband and son and two
daughters to look after. She and Jim were
to have two other daughters, to repeat as they
always said, another group of four new Ranch
Girls. But as yet only two had put in their
appearance.</p>

<p>"Yes, and after she has had breakfast I
want to take Jack and everybody down to the
Rainbow Mine. I always feel it belongs<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
more to Ralph, and to me than to the others.
Oh, simply because my husband was its first
engineer."</p>

<p>Jean's eyes were as brown and velvety as
ever and she wore that little expression of pride
and self satisfaction that comes into the faces
of so many women who are married to successful
men. It is as if they shared the pride
and glory of the success, without any of the
effort or necessary disappointment.</p>

<p>"Remember, Henry, when you and Ralph
were more or less blown up going down the
shaft of the old mine. It was after that,
Frieda adopted you."</p>

<p>The Professor nodded. "I had my legs
broken didn't I, so I couldn't get away?
Well, Frieda always prefers her victims
helpless."</p>

<p>Frieda tossed her head and walked away as
she always had done when any member of her
family teased her.</p>

<p>Later in the day all the family and half a
dozen visitors did go down to the old mine,
which was still yielding a fair amount of gold,
but not half so much as in the old days.
Afterwards, lunch was served in the neighborhood
of Rainbow creek and most of the day
was spent outdoors.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span></p>

<p>Toward the close of the afternoon, however,
everybody else wandered away leaving the
four one time Ranch Girls together.</p>

<p>They were sitting in the afternoon sunshine
on a patch of grass not far from the neighborhood
of the creek.</p>

<p>Jack was lying down with her head resting
in Olive's lap, Frieda was close to Jean
and now and then putting her hand inside
her cousin's for a moment. She and Jean
had always been cronies in the old days, when
the four of them had been divided into pairs
over some small issue.</p>

<p>"I don't believe this is far from the place
where Frank and I discovered the first gold in
Rainbow creek," Jack remarked drowsily, a
little worn out from the excitement of the
day. "How filled the old ranch was with
memories and thoughts of her husband!"
Jack smiled to herself. Certainly she had
been the impatient one and Frank the patient
in those many months of her long illness.</p>

<p>Whatever anger Jack had felt in regard to
her husband's autocratic attitude toward her,
had entirely disappeared soon after saying
farewell to him. But the puzzle was still
present. Frank had been kind and sweet to
her for the time before she left home. But<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
never once had he frankly declared that in
future he would be willing for Jack to decide
important questions according to her
own judgment, even as he must act by his
own. And this was what Jack wanted, the
sense of spiritual freedom.</p>

<p>"When is Frank coming over to join you,
Jack?" Jean Merritt asked unexpectedly.
"Ralph hopes to get home from his work at
the canal in a few weeks and it would be a
great pleasure if he and Frank could be here
at the same time."</p>

<p>"Frank, oh, Frank isn't coming at all,
Jean. He couldn't possibly leave his own
country now, while they are at war. There
is so much he feels he ought to do."</p>

<p>Jack hoped she was not blushing, but was
painfully aware that Frieda's eyes were fixed
somewhat critically upon her. Frieda was
giving herself more airs than ever, now that
she and her Professor were reconciled, and she
had been able to persuade the British Government
to allow her to bring him to the United
States. The truth was the Professor had
finished the scientific work he had undertaken,
and in coming to his own country at the
present time would be enabled to get hold of
materials much needed in England.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span></p>

<p>Not actually realizing, but guessing at
Jack's embarrassment, Olive remarked hastily.</p>

<p>"After all there is some advantage in being
an old maid, one does not have to worry continually
over being in the same place with
one's husband. You will all have to come
over to see my Indian School some day soon.
Perhaps I am wedded to that."</p>

<p>"Nonsense, Olive," Frieda murmured, "but
really I don't see why you have never married.
You were obstinate enough about not accepting
poor Don Harmon, but then you got most
of your grandmother's money after all. Still
you must have had other chances. You are
as good looking as the rest of us and some
people like brunettes best."</p>

<p>As Frieda's own yellow hair was at this
moment unbound, so that it might get the air
and sunshine, and as she looked at it with
utter satisfaction as she spoke, her three
companions laughed unrestrainedly.</p>

<p>"Oh, come now Frieda, you don't really
believe anyone has such poor taste as that,"
Olive teased.</p>

<p>But at this instant seeing that Jack's nurse
was coming toward them carrying Vive in her
arms, Frieda got the best of the situation as
she often did.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, well, perhaps the combination is
prettiest after all. Vive is the only real
beauty with her dark eyes and yellow hair."</p>

<p>Frieda held out her arms for the baby, who
came to her with little ripples of happy
laughter, and the two blonde heads, which
were so nearly the same color, were held close
together.</p>

<p>"I believe Vive really is the prettiest of all
the children," Jean remarked critically, which
was good of her, since she had a little girl of
her own.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVI</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>VIVE<br /><br /><br /></div>


<div class='cap'>SO the days and weeks passed on at the
Rainbow Ranch, seeming to be uneventful
and yet filled with quantities of
pleasures and interests.</div>

<p>June came and the prairies were covered
with wild flowers.</p>

<p>No one stayed indoors, except to sleep and
eat, and oftentimes not for either of these
things. Many nights Jack slept out on the
Lodge verandah, sometimes with Olive or
Jean, more often alone.</p>

<p>There were wonderful white nights such as
only the west knows.</p>

<p>Jack used to love to lie and listen to the
sounds she had long known and loved. A
pair of owls in one of the old cottonwood trees
held nightly conversations with each other,
now and then screeching in such an irritated
fashion that Jack laughed over their apparently
human qualities.</p>

<p>Then far away from the house on the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
neighboring prairies she could hear the coyotes
call to one another with warnings of danger.</p>

<p>These were excellent nights in which to
think, for sometimes the moon made it almost
too light for sleep. And Jack had a great
deal to occupy her mind. Twice a week she
wrote Frank and he wrote her with the same
frequency, since at this time there were still
two mail boats a week. But neither made any
reference to their conversation on the evening
when Jack had made her request to come
home and given her reason.</p>

<p>Things in England were not going so well
at this period as Frank had hoped, and he
wrote chiefly of this. But he also said that he
now received frequent news from Captain
MacDonnell, who was growing better and now
knew what fate had in store for him. He
might be able to walk in the future, but only
with crutches.</p>

<p>On several occasions Jack thought of deliberately
asking her husband to come to some
kind of an agreement with her for the future.
Yet she hardly dared open a subject that
might lead to differences between them, when
they were so far apart, but she was very
often lonely for him and sometimes repented
having left England at all.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span></p>

<p>Jack, of course, was not always in this
frame of mind. During the greater part of the
time she was very happy.</p>

<p>A number of hours each day she spent on
the horse Jim had given her, which she had
named "Britain" in honor of her adopted
country.</p>

<p>Now and then Jean and Olive and Frieda
would refuse to ride, preferring some other
amusement, but there was always Jim as a
companion.</p>

<p>Jim Colter was now a successful and fairly
wealthy ranchman owning a half interest in
the Rainbow Ranch and having the entire
ownership of the one adjoining it. But he continued
to follow much the same routine as when
he was only the manager for the Ranch girls.</p>

<p>That is, whenever it was possible, he rode
over miles of the ranch land, watching the
crops and his water supply, and carefully
examining all his horses and cattle, when they
seemed to need his attention.</p>

<p>Accompanying Jim on these excursions had
been, not only one of Jack's chief amusements,
but one of her serious occupations as a girl
and it still greatly interested her. Besides,
she and Jim saw each other under more favorable
circumstances in this way than in any<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
other, and had more real opportunities for
conversation.</p>

<p>But always Jack arranged to get back to the
Lodge in time to see her children before they
went to bed. They had an excellent nurse and
of course there was all the rest of the family
to look after them, but Jack had followed this
custom at home, except under unusual circumstances
and would not have given it up
for a great deal.</p>

<p>Therefore she was worried one afternoon
when Jim insisted upon staying out later than
usual. She would have returned alone, except
that Jim had found a young colt which had
injured itself and wished Jack's help and
advice in the care of it.</p>

<p>Finally, when they did get started for home,
Jack rode ahead like the wind, calling back
to her companion not to try to follow her
unless he liked, as she knew he had some other
matters on the place to look after.</p>

<p>By making unusual speed she hoped to
reach home a few minutes before six, when
Vive was put into bed and Jimmie ate his
supper before following her.</p>

<p>Olive was waiting on the porch when Jack
came into sight and went out to meet her
before she had dismounted.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span></p>

<p>"What is it, Olive?" Jack asked sharply, as
soon as she saw her. "Which one of the
children is it? What has happened?" For it
is a curious fact that a mother often feels this
premonition of danger.</p>

<p>"There is nothing to be seriously frightened
about, Jack," Olive replied quietly, "only
little Vive isn't very well. Frieda and I had
her with us for a little while this afternoon and
she seemed somewhat languid. Frieda
thought she had a little fever, so Ruth saw her
and we have sent for the doctor. He will be
here in another few moments."</p>

<p>Jack made no comment except to go
swiftly indoors, leaving Olive to find some one
to care for her horse.</p>

<p>She knew, of course, that Olive was telling
her as little as possible.</p>

<p>Jimmie had been taken away to the other
house, so Vive now occupied alone the big
room at the Lodge which had belonged to
Jack and Frieda when they were little girls.</p>

<p>It was simply furnished with a few rugs and
wicker chairs and bright pictures and three
little white iron cots.</p>

<p>In the smallest Vive lay apparently asleep
on her pillow.</p>

<p>But Jack saw at once she was not asleep.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
Her exquisite little face was flushed a bright
scarlet, her lids heavy and closed, and the
strangest fact was that one of her little hands
twitched unceasingly.</p>

<p>Now and then she opened her golden brown
eyes, but without seeing or knowing anyone.</p>

<p>When the doctor arrived he made no effort
to disguise the seriousness of Vive's condition.
If she were to live it would be a fight and one
of the hardest of all kinds, since they must
simply wait and watch, with very little possible
to do.</p>

<p>For some unknown reason, perhaps because
there had been too much excitement from the
trip, too much notice taken of her by too many
people, Vive had meningitis.</p>

<p>But Jack was never a coward and it is
scarcely worth saying that a mother's courage,
so long as she thinks it can help her child,
is the purest courage of all.</p>

<p>As soon as she heard the verdict, Jack
went quickly to her own room and put on a
white cotton dress. Afterwards, until Vive
was better or worse, she would never leave
her side for a moment.</p>

<p>But it is one thing to be brave when a
shock comes and one has health and strength
to meet it. It is another to keep up that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
courage hour after hour, day after day, when
the strength is gone and the body and mind
unconsciously sick with weariness.</p>

<p>There was a trained nurse, of course, and any
member of her family would have done anything
that was humanly possible to relieve
Jack's vigil. But she would not be persuaded
or argued into going out of her baby's room,
and slept there in the hours when she did
sleep, half awake and half dreaming, on a
small cot by Vive's.</p>

<p>And most of the time Frieda stayed with
her.</p>

<p>In a way it seems strange that it should
have been Frieda. Olive, one would have
supposed to be more sympathetic, Jean and
Ruth had children of their own.</p>

<p>But some change had been taking place in
Frieda for a good many months and she
adored little Vive. Whenever any of the
others disputed Frieda's right, she always
said quietly that after all, she was Jack's only
sister, and that if anything happened she
must be the one to be by her.</p>

<p>If Jack's husband had been with her, why
then it would have been different. So Frieda
even waved away her devoted Professor,
who feared she might be ill, by telling him<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
there would be time enough to think of her
later on.</p>

<p>Although she and Jack sat side by side for
many hours with their eyes on the baby, they
but rarely spoke to each other.</p>

<p>Yet it was too pitiful to continue always to
watch the movement of Vive's baby hands
and her heavy breathing.</p>

<p>"If Vive dies do you think Frank will ever
forgive me," Jack asked one night.</p>

<p>And true to herself Frieda tossed her yellow
head.</p>

<p>"I don't see what Frank has to forgive?
The point is will he ever forgive himself for
having you go through all this alone?"</p>

<p>"But I ought not to have brought Vive
away. Still I wouldn't mind anything if
only Frank were with me."</p>

<p>A little later when the doctor arrived he
said that the crisis would come within the
hour and he would remain.</p>

<p>Olive and Jean waited in the Lodge living
room, Jim had disappeared somewhere an
hour before. Ruth Colter came into the
nursery and stayed by Jack.</p>

<p>Half an hour passed. Then suddenly there
was a strange, almost an unearthly silence in
the room, and it was as if one could see the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
little white soul rise and float softly away like
a bird.</p>

<p>The little figure in the cradle was still.</p>

<p>The doctor rose up.</p>

<p>"It is over," he said pitifully.</p>

<p>Frieda covered up her face, but Jack went
over and looked down at Vive for a moment
and then turned to the others.</p>

<p>"Please do not let anyone come with me,"
she asked. "I must go outdoors alone."</p>

<p>Then Jack went out past the living room,
through the long avenue of tall trees, on
farther and farther, not knowing where she
was going.</p>

<p>The Rainbow Ranch, which she had loved
better than any place in the world, had taken
from her the human being, whom at this
moment she believed she loved most.</p>

<p>Over Rainbow creek there hung a tiny
yellow, crescent moon. It seemed to Jack that
this, too, made her think of her baby, it was
just as cold, just as perfect and as far away.</p>

<p>She stayed there a long time, then getting
up she wandered on. She did not think
whether her family would be uneasy, she did
not care.</p>

<p>It seemed to her she never wished to go
back again to the Lodge.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span></p>

<p>But finally a little clearer judgment came to
her and she turned back.</p>

<p>It was almost dawn.</p>

<p>There, standing on the porch of the Rainbow
Lodge, was a man's figure. Jack supposed it
was Jim.</p>

<p>He started toward her and the next moment
Jack was in his arms.</p>

<p>"Do you know, Frank?" Jack queried.</p>

<p>Frank drew her closer to him.</p>

<p>A little later she allowed Frank to lead
her into the house, where she undressed
and went to bed, with him sitting beside
her.</p>

<p>She had made no inquiry about how he had
arrived at such a moment. Jack had but one
thought at this time, no others could enter
her mind.</p>

<p>The facts were that Frank had left England
ten days before bringing Captain MacDonnell
with him. He had a mission from his Government
so as to make the trip possible. But
more than anything else he felt he must see
his wife.</p>

<p>He had tried to write Jack, to tell her
that he believed he had been unfair, that
his obstinacy should never make an issue
between them again. But it had all been so<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
difficult to write and it must be so long before
he could receive Jack's answer.</p>

<p>Moreover, Frank wanted to bring Captain
MacDonnell to the ranch to stay during his
convalescence. Soon after Jack's departure
he had gone over to France, as an act of
expiation both to his wife and friend. There
he had found Captain MacDonnell recovering,
but infinitely depressed with the thought that
he could no longer serve his country, but must
be only a burden.</p>

<p>On the arrival of his steamer in New York
Lord Kent had wired Jim Colter, but Jim had
thought it best not to speak to Jack until
Frank was able to reach her.</p>

<p>He had therefore sent him a wire telling
of Vive's illness, and Frank had hurried west,
leaving Captain MacDonnell with friends in
New York city.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER XVII</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>FAREWELL<br /><br /><br /></div>


<div class='cap'>ABOUT a week later Captain MacDonnell
arrived at the Rainbow Ranch
accompanied by a man servant who
waited upon him. He looked better than
any of his friends had anticipated.</div>

<p>Since there was so much sorrow in the
world at the present time, Jack and Frank
had made up their minds that they would not
let their own influence other people more than
they could avoid. Moreover, they had found
each other again at just the right moment and
were more devoted, more united than ever
before. Frank explained his own change of
attitude to his wife, but all the events of the
past seemed small in comparison with their
loss.</p>

<p>It was Frieda who for a while seemed the
more outwardly inconsolable.</p>

<p>Actually the Professor came one day in distress
to Jack herself.</p>

<p>"My dear Jack, I don't know what I shall<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
do with my little Frieda when you have gone
home to England!" he exclaimed. For it had
been decided that Jack and Jimmie were to
return home when Frank did.</p>

<p>"But you will both be coming over soon,"
Jack answered, showing no sign that it might
be strange under the circumstances to expect
her to comfort Frieda.</p>

<p>The Professor did not see this. He really
saw very little else in the world except his
wife and his work.</p>

<p>"We may not be able to come for several
months. In the meantime if she frets herself
ill?"</p>

<p>Jack promised to talk to her sister.</p>

<p>One evening when Frieda complained of a
headache and did not come down to dinner,
Jack went up to her.</p>

<p>She found her sister lying on a couch and
looking very young and sweet.</p>

<p>"You are not to worry too much on my
account, Frieda dear," Jack began.</p>

<p>"I am not supposed to be unselfish," Frieda
murmured.</p>

<p>But Jack paid no attention to her speech.
"Perhaps you'll have a baby some day yourself,
dear."</p>

<p>At this Frieda pulled her sister down and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
<ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'whispering'">whispered</ins> something in her ear. Jack's face
flushed.</p>

<p>"I should be happier than anything!
Remember you and Henry are to come to us
as soon as it can be arranged."</p>

<p>A few days later Lord and Lady Kent with
their little boy left for the East. They were
to stop a few days in Washington and then
sail.</p>

<p>Not long afterwards Frieda and the Professor
also went away from the ranch, as
Professor Russell had a good many things
to look after and Frieda would not be separated
from him.</p>

<p>As Ralph Merritt had arrived for a visit,
Jean's attention was occupied with him. So
as a matter of fact Captain MacDonnell was
rather left to Olive's care.</p>

<p>At first it did not seem a large duty simply
to try and keep Captain MacDonnell amused
and she had wanted to do something. But
Olive had not reckoned with her task.</p>

<p>Captain MacDonnell was an Irishman and
a Scotchman, which means he was able to be
very gay and also very melancholy. And
always in times past, when his melancholy
mood had taken hold on him, he could mount
his horse and ride the spectre away, or else<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
engage in some other active outdoor occupation.</p>

<p>But here he was still so young a man, with
all his future before him, and compelled to sit
all day in a wheeled chair, or else hobble about
on crutches.</p>

<p>It has not been the illness that has been
hardest for the soldiers to bear, but oftentimes
this coming back to accept with resignation
a new kind of life.</p>

<p>Yet Captain MacDonnell tried to be
patient, tried to let no one guess what he was
suffering at thus having his career ended so
soon, and being also unable to go on with the
service to his country which he so longed to
give.</p>

<p>But Olive, who had always more of a gift
for sympathy than any one of the Ranch girls,
appreciated what he was enduring more than
she even revealed to him.</p>

<p>She had been reading him a volume of Kipling
one day, and happening to raise her eyes,
saw that he was not listening. She even
stopped a few moments and found that he was
unaware of it.</p>

<p>When Captain MacDonnell did discover his
own absorption, he turned to Olive with a
charming smile.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span></p>

<p>"Forgive me," he explained. "I do not
intend to be ungrateful, indeed I am more
grateful than I know how to express. But
those stories of India started me to thinking
of the first years I was out there. It is a
strange country, India. I don't think we
western people understand it."</p>

<p>He and Olive were sitting on the Lodge
verandah.</p>

<p>Olive nodded, "I do understand what you
must feel and I do wish there was something
else to interest you."</p>

<p>Then she remained silent. After all Captain
MacDonnell could not go on in idleness like
this. There must be something he could
find to do, some real thing. Poorer men were
learning trades. It would be better for him
to do this if only he could be persuaded to
feel enough interest.</p>

<p>Olive did not realize she was frowning.</p>

<p>Suddenly she exclaimed.</p>

<p>"Look here, Captain MacDonnell, didn't
I hear Frank say once that you used to be
fond of drawing when you were a small boy,
that you were once undecided whether to be
an artist or a soldier?"</p>

<p>Captain MacDonnell smiled. "I believe so,
I've an idea I was a pretty conceited youngster<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
and would have made as much of a failure at
one as I have of the other."</p>

<p>But Olive refused to pay any attention to
this speech.</p>

<p>For a moment Captain MacDonnell forgot
himself thinking of how attractive Olive
looked.</p>

<p>He had not remembered thinking of this
especially when they had met in England,
only that she was unusual looking and not in
the least like an American or English woman.
It was almost as if she might be Spanish.
Captain MacDonnell also had some Spanish
blood farther back in his own family, when the
Spanish were the great voyagers and visited
and settled on the coasts of Ireland.</p>

<p>But Olive went on talking.</p>

<p>"I do wish you would undertake the drawing
again, it might at least amuse you, and
there are so many interesting people and
scenes you could attempt out here."</p>

<p>Captain MacDonnell shook his head.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid the time has gone by for that,"
he returned.</p>

<p>But Olive had a kind of gentle, sensible
persistency that nearly always wins its
way.</p>

<p>"Still, there wouldn't be any harm in just<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
seeing if it might amuse you," she went on.
"I am sure it would be a kind of relief."</p>

<p>Captain MacDonnell again looked at
Olive. Her deep toned skin was softly flushed
and her dark eyes brilliant with earnestness.</p>

<p>He laughed a little. "Of course it will, a
relief to you, so for that reason I'll attempt it.
But on one condition?"</p>

<p>Olive flushed a little with embarrassment,
since she had never wholly gotten over her
shyness. However, she realized that Captain
MacDonnell was teasing her. He did very
often when he was in a gay humor and Olive
felt it was good for her, as she was too inclined
to be grave.</p>

<p>"What is the condition?" she inquired.
"Of course it will be relief to me to know you
are happier," at which Captain MacDonnell
felt that Olive had scored.</p>

<p>"Why, that I won't have to keep on calling
you Miss Van Mater. It is too much of a
name, just as mine is."</p>

<p>Captain MacDonnell was doubtful as to
how Olive would receive this suggestion.
She seemed more formal than the rest of the
family and he had thought her colder until her
great kindness to him. Now he at least knew<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
better than to misunderstand her shyness for
coldness, as a good many people did.</p>

<p>Olive replied perfectly naturally.</p>

<p>"Of course I will. The truth is I have
always thought of you as Bryan, as Jack and
Frank always talked of you by this name."</p>

<p>His promise would have really passed out of
Captain MacDonnell's mind if Olive had not
supplied him with a great variety of drawing
materials within a few days, which she had
taken a good deal of trouble to secure for him.</p>

<p>But as a matter of fact she was really surprised
to discover how much talent he had.
But then Captain MacDonnell used to work
for many hours each day, so that it was not
long before his former facility came back to
him. More than this, he discovered to his own
surprise as well, that he could do a great deal
better work than he had as a boy. Somehow
the skill must have developed in him unheeded
as he was growing older.</p>

<p>She came out on the lawn one afternoon and
discovered Captain MacDonnell at work a
little distance off.</p>

<p>He had evidently persuaded one of the cowboys
to pose for him, as the man and his
horse were standing in a picturesque attitude
only a few feet away.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span></p>

<p>Olive walked over to them and stood
studying the drawing until Captain MacDonnell
turned round to speak to her.</p>

<p>"Why don't you say it is good?" he
demanded boyishly. "You know I've half
an idea it is."</p>

<p>Olive nodded enthusiastically.</p>

<p>"It's like Remington."</p>

<p>Captain MacDonnell laughed. "Not quite.
Still I am getting on. But it seems to me you
are neglecting me lately. I say, suppose you
pose for me. That would be ripping. You
won't be sensitive if I don't make much of a
go just at first."</p>

<p>For a moment Olive hesitated. Then it
struck her that she would enjoy sitting outdoors
in the early autumn sunshine for a few
hours each day with her friend. For Captain
MacDonnell had become her friend by this
time, she had no doubts on this point. Moreover,
she had made up her mind she must soon
go away. She had planned to take a course in
nursing so as to fit herself to be more useful, and
there was really no reason for further delay.</p>

<p>She happened to mention this fact to Captain
MacDonnell one day and it was remarkable
after that what a time he took to finish
his sketch.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span></p>

<p>The truth was the artist made not one
sketch but half a dozen.</p>

<p>Jim and Ruth were delighted with his success,
so that Captain MacDonnell finally <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'persuded'">persuaded</ins>
Olive to allow him to attempt a painting.</p>

<p>The work was undertaken inside the Lodge
living room. Olive was dressed in an old
gold silk, and the artist insisted that she
needed a background of strange oriental colors.</p>

<p>One end of the great room was therefore
changed into a studio.</p>

<p>Fortunately Ruth and Olive had still in
their possession a number of lovely old silks
and draperies which the Ranch girls had
brought back from their trip to Italy many
years before.</p>

<p>One day, after he had been working for
about a month, Olive slipped quietly into the
studio without the artist's hearing her. She
found him sitting before his easel smoking,
but frowning and looking less happy than he
had in some time.</p>

<p>But as he caught sight of Olive his expression
changed.</p>

<p>"I don't know how I'll ever be able to thank
you for making me so lovely? I don't mind
being handed down to posterity in such a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
delightfully untruthful picture," Olive remarked
gayly.</p>

<p>"Oh, it's untruthful enough," Captain
MacDonnell answered. "It is well you came
in just when you did, as I was thinking of
making an end of it."</p>

<p>"Then I shouldn't have forgiven you."</p>

<p>Captain MacDonnell nodded.</p>

<p>"That is what I was afraid of, that and
that you would not be willing to sit for me
again."</p>

<p>Olive laughed. "Oh, you must get hold of
someone more attractive than I am for the
next portrait. After a while, as you are so
much better, you'll be wanting to go back to
London to work seriously. You know you
have promised me that?"</p>

<p>Captain MacDonnell shook his head.</p>

<p>"No," he returned. "Oh, I don't mean
that I did not promise, I only mean that I
shall probably not keep my word. I think
I shall give up and allow myself to become a
kind of good for nothing, half invalid, as soon
as I am separated from you."</p>

<p>However, as she had by this time grown accustomed
to her companion's swift changes
of mood, so unlike her own, Olive only laughed?</p>

<p>"Shall I pose for you again today?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span></p>

<p>Then there was silence in the room for
half an hour while Bryan worked. Finally
he put down his brushes.</p>

<p>"I am no good for work today, Olive. The
truth is I want to say something to you and I
don't know whether I have the right.</p>

<p>"Olive!"</p>

<p>For an instant Olive changed color. Then
she answered.</p>

<p>"I can hardly imagine anything you haven't
the right to say to me, Bryan. You often
talk of your gratitude for what I have done
for you. But I wonder if you know what
you have done for me? I have never had so
kind a friend except Jack. It is always difficult
for me to think of her as Lady Kent."</p>

<p>"But I am not your friend," Bryan returned
brusquely, "and it is about that and about
Lady Jack I want to talk to you. The truth
is it's absurd to call a man your friend when
he loves you. Of course I feel I am not all
of a man these days and I have not much
money and my art may never come to anything."</p>

<p>"Any more disqualifications, Bryan?"
Olive asked softly. Perhaps she was not
altogether surprised at what she was at
present hearing.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh yes, a great many," Captain MacDonnell
returned, "only I think I won't tell you
about them just now."</p>

<p>"And what has Jack to do with what you
wish to say to me?" Olive asked, and this
time spoke more seriously.</p>

<p>"Oh, she has nothing at all to do with it
now," Captain MacDonnell returned. "Only
once upon a time before I met you, I used to
think Lady Jack was the most attractive
woman I had ever known. I used also to
believe that as long as Frank had gotten ahead
of me I never wished to marry. But I suppose
the real fact was that I wanted one of what
Lady Jack told me you called yourselves?
The Ranch Girls, wasn't it? Only I had not
seen the real one in those days."</p>

<p>"Look here, Bryan, you need not think I
ever forget you are an Irishman," Olive
laughed. "Yet I think I like your flattery."</p>

<p>However, Captain MacDonnell was waiting
for another kind of answer, and after a little
Olive gave him the one he desired.</p>

<p>So began for Olive, what still remains, in
spite of all the other adventures in life, the
great adventure of marriage.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVIII</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>"UNDER TWO FLAGS"<br /><br /><br /></div>


<div class='cap'>ON an afternoon in summer nearly
a year later, two flags might be seen
flying from the towers of Kent House.</div>

<p>Over the English meadows the wind blew
softly, but strongly enough to whip the flags
out straight so that from some distance one
could see the British Lion and the Stars
and Stripes.</p>

<p>Since Olive's engagement to Captain MacDonnell,
the United States had entered the
war and was now one of the great Allies.</p>

<p>Inside Kent House there was a peculiar
atmosphere of excitement and expectancy.</p>

<p>The house was filled with flowers from the
big garden, a profusion of roses and the simpler
flowers for which England is famous,
wall flowers, daisies, sweet-peas and canterbury
bells, named in honor of the great
Cathedral at Canterbury.</p>

<p>In the dining room, which opened just
back of the library, the table was already
laid for dinner.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span></p>

<p>Evidently there was to be a gala occasion,
and yet this was unusual, for since the war
began there had been few entertainments
at Kent House or in any great English
home.</p>

<p>Nevertheless Lady Kent herself presently
came into the dining room and looked with
the deepest interest at the beautiful table,
touching things here and there and making
slight alterations in the arrangement of the
flowers.</p>

<p>The table was in white except for a stripe
of rose-colored satin through the center and
a bowl of pink roses.</p>

<p>Jack had on a house dress of some soft
white material, as she was not wearing
mourning and had not worn it after Vive's
death. There was too much black being
used in the world.</p>

<p>She was standing still for a moment,
frowning slightly, but with interest, not
dissatisfaction, when another person entered
and came up beside her.</p>

<p>"I have been taking a long walk, Jack,
trying to get rid of my restlessness and to
make the time pass more swiftly. I wish
you had been with me. But how beautiful
your place is! I don't see how you have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
managed to keep things in such splendid
condition with so many of your men at the
front. I have been talking to some real
English dairymaids down in the left paddock.
They made me think of the stories
and nursery rhymes we used to read when
we were children. Then England seemed as
far away from the old Wyoming ranch as
the planet Mars. However, I am the last one
of the Ranch Girls to visit you in England.
Ralph's work has made our coming to you
impossible before and now the war has
brought us to this side of the world, for how
long none of us can say. Have you heard
anything from Frieda?"</p>

<p>Lady Kent shook her head slowly.</p>

<p>She was watching Jean and at the same
time thinking how pretty and untroubled
she looked. Jean's marriage to Ralph Merritt
seemed to have turned out an unqualified
success. Ralph had come to be known
as a leading American engineer, but now had
given up all the other work he had been
engaged in to offer his services as an engineer
to France. And Jean had left her little
girl at home with Jim and Ruth at the Rainbow
Ranch so that she could be nearer
her husband.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span></p>

<p>"I wish Frieda had not gone to London
today. Suppose something happens and she
is not back in time for our dinner! Then
everything will be disarranged. We cannot
have our dinner party tomorrow, for by that
time we will have separated again. Tomorrows
are uncertain quantities these days,
aren't they?" And Jean's expression changed
for an instant.</p>

<p>But Jack answered her quickly. This
was to be Ralph Merritt's last night in
England for an indefinite time, as he was
leaving for France the next day, while Jean
was to remain with Lord and Lady Kent.</p>

<p>"Oh, Frieda will be here on time; I don't
think we need worry. You see, she is to go
to his office and get hold of the Professor,
else, Frieda says, if he chances to be especially
interested in his work, he will forget all
about our plan, and of course to have one
of the eight of us missing tonight would
ruin everything." Again Jack glanced about
her dinner table, which was laid for eight
covers. "Still, I think Frieda does Henry
an injustice, for, in spite of the absorbing
scientific work he is doing, he is far less
absent-minded than he used to be. And I
never saw a more attentive husband. Since<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
Frieda's baby came I believe he regards
her as more wonderful than ever."</p>

<p>As she finished speaking Jack laughed
and Jean slipped her arm about her as they
walked out of the dining room. Jean was
thinking of another baby, who had gone
away before the new one came and of Jack's
inexhaustible courage. They had not realized
in the old Rainbow Ranch days that
she had so much spiritual as well as physical
courage.</p>

<p>"Well, I am glad Frieda has your old
nurse for her baby, Jack, and is living here
with you, for I cannot take her seriously as
a mother, never having been able to realize
thoroughly that she is properly and sedately
married. However, we at least have our
guests of honor safe."</p>

<p>Lady Kent nodded in response.</p>

<p>"Yes, I have just seen Olive. She and
Bryan are both resting, so as to get the most
out of their wedding dinner tonight. It
was wise of them to come up so early from
London this morning. I declare, Jean, it
is one of the most beautiful things that ever
happened for Olive and Bryan to have
married.</p>

<p>"Just from a selfish standpoint you can't<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
imagine what it will mean to have Olive living
so near me. I have so missed my family!"</p>

<p>Smiling Jean shook her brown head
thoughtfully.</p>

<p>"At present there is not much danger of
your missing your family for some time to
come, dear. You and Frank will probably
grow exceedingly tired of them. Now I must
go upstairs to rest for a while myself. I don't
wish to have Ralph decide tonight that he is
the least fortunate of the four husbands."</p>

<p>Jean Merritt went on ahead, Jack seeing
her disappear, and then stopping for a moment
to speak to her butler.</p>

<p>Although it was to be only a family party
tonight, she was taking far more interest
in the arrangements for her dinner than she
had ever been known to do before for the
most formal occasions.</p>

<p>But then this dinner was to be unusual,
since it was the first time the four old-time
Ranch Girls had ever been her own and her
husband's guests at Kent House. Moreover,
their husbands were also with them,
even Olive and Captain MacDonnell, who
had been married only a few weeks.</p>

<p>Nearly a year had passed since Olive's and
Captain MacDonnell's engagement, although<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
the wedding had not taken place until the
present summer. The scene of the marriage
was the Rainbow Ranch, with only Jim and
Ruth, their children, and a few friends
present, since the rest of the family were in
Europe. But immediately after the ceremony
Olive and Bryan had decided to risk
the dangers of sailing for home and had
landed safely in England only the day before.</p>

<p>Having spent the night in London, they
had come directly to Kent House, knowing that
Jack planned a family party in their honor.</p>

<p>A good many months before, Frieda and
her Professor had arrived at Kent House,
so that Frieda's baby might be born with
Frieda in her sister's care. Moreover, the
Professor was working harder than ever,
since his own country had entered the war, to
accomplish certain scientific discoveries which
should counteract the German terrorism.</p>

<p>A little more than an hour later Lady Kent
was slowly getting ready for dinner. She
wished to be dressed first and downstairs
ready to receive her family.</p>

<p>Nevertheless she was frowning and looking
slightly disturbed.</p>

<p>She had left word that she was to be
informed as soon as her sister, Mrs. Russell,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
returned from London. In the meantime
she knew a train had arrived from town,
yet no word came to her.</p>

<p>Jack was about to ring the bell and find
out if her order had been forgotten, when
a light knock came at the door and her
husband entered.</p>

<p>"I came out early, Jack, dear, in order to do
honor to your party and I managed to corral
the two other husbands, Ralph and the Professor,
so there need be no delay. It is good
to be at home now and then."</p>

<p>Frank had looked a little tired, but his
face cleared at the sight of his wife. Jack
was very beautiful in a white evening gown.
The frock was not new, since she was buying
nothing of the kind during the war,
but it was the handsomest one she owned
and the most becoming. She had planned
with Jean and Frieda that they were to look as
well as possible, since the dinner was to be one
they would never forget. Moreover, Olive was
a bride and they must also do her honor.</p>

<p>Since the change in government Frank
Kent had been made a member of the War
Cabinet and devoted most of his time to the
great intellectual labors it demanded of him.
Frequently it was impossible for him to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
return more than two or three times a week
to Kent House.</p>

<p>As Jack kissed her husband her expression
lightened.</p>

<p>"I would like to give a dinner party every
night, Frank, if I thought it would bring
you home. Are things going well?"</p>

<p>Then, as Frank nodded his head gravely (he
and Jack did not often discuss details of his
work, since government secrets were not to be
mentioned even with her), she added, with a
little sigh partly of relief and partly vexation:</p>

<p>"Well, thank goodness you got hold of
Frieda! Jean has been worrying for fear
Frieda would get lost in London and not
come back in time. Years ago, when we
first came to Europe, Frieda had a tiresome
fashion of disappearing and getting us all
into a dreadful state of mind for fear she
might be permanently lost. Then she usually
turned up quite blandly with some agreeable
person who had discovered her."</p>

<p>"But, Jack dear," Frank interrupted, as
soon as his wife gave him the opportunity,
"Frieda did not come home with us. Indeed,
neither the Professor nor I had any idea
except that she was with you."</p>

<p>Jack changed color.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, dear, I do wish Frieda would come
in! What do you suppose could have happened
to her, Frank? She only went into
London to attend to some mysterious errand
which she insisted was very important. I
know she would not have stayed so late
unless something unavoidable had kept her.
Besides our party, she has never been away
from her baby so long."</p>

<p>Man-like, Frank did not appear particularly
agitated.</p>

<p>"Oh, Frieda will turn up all right. The
good fates have her in charge." Then he
disappeared to begin his own toilet.</p>

<p>Finishing her toilet as quickly as possible,
Jack hurried downstairs.</p>

<p>There was no train now from London until
after eight o'clock and dinner had been
ordered for half-past seven.</p>

<p>In the hall Jack discovered her Professor
brother-in-law wandering disconsolately
about. He wore a mystified and slightly
harassed air.</p>

<p>"Do you know, Jack, I am unable for
some reason to find Frieda. She is not in
her bedroom and not in the nursery. Nurse
is unable to give me any information concerning
her, save that she left early in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
day for London. Curious that she did not
telephone me. Will you please find her
for me? She gave me certain instructions
about dressing for dinner tonight, which,
as a matter of fact, I have forgotten. Am
I to wear an evening or a dinner coat?"</p>

<p>The distinguished Professor looked so uncertain
and so uncomfortable that Jack laughed
in spite of her own anxiety and annoyance.
However, she hated to confide Frieda's disappearance
to her husband, knowing he would
be frightened about her.</p>

<p>She was hesitating as to what to reply when
there was a sudden noise at the front door.
Opening it, an excited and somewhat disheveled
Frieda Russell rushed in and up to her
husband.</p>

<p>"Oh, Henry dear, do let me have two
pounds, won't you, at once. I know it is
dreadful to be so extravagant, but so many
things have happened to me! I had to wait
and wait for the things I just had to have
for tonight and then I missed the last train.
I wasn't going to spoil our dinner party and
so I took a taxi the entire way out from
London. I know the cabby is robbing
me, but he did come very fast and I haven't
a great deal of my own money left."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span></p>

<p>The Professor shook his head, not fully
understanding all that Frieda was saying
so hurriedly. But he produced the two
pounds and went out to settle with his wife's
cabman, while Frieda rushed upstairs, calling
down over the balustrade:</p>

<p>"How is my adored baby, Jack? I have
nearly died being separated from her such
hours! Don't worry, I'll be ready in time
for dinner."</p>

<p>Not long after, Frank and Jack were in
their library waiting for their guests to appear.</p>

<p>Olive and Captain MacDonnell slipped in
quietly before the others.</p>

<p>Olive was wearing her wedding gown.
But as the affair had been a quiet one,
owing to the war and to Captain MacDonnell's
injury, it was a simple dress of white
silk and chiffon.</p>

<p>Except for her husband's wedding gift, a
brooch of emeralds and diamonds in the form
of a shamrock, she wore no jewels.</p>

<p>Captain MacDonnell was still lame, would
probably always remain so. Nevertheless
Jack and Frank thought they had never seen
their old friend looking better or handsomer.
Olive's shyness, her seriousness, seemed
just the spur his Irish wit and gayety needed.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span></p>

<p>"I do hope, Bryan, you and Olive are going
to stay on at home for a time now you are
safely here," Lord Kent remarked, stretching
himself lazily in a great arm chair and glancing
with an admiration he made no effort to
conceal from his wife to Olive. "Jack more
or less needs some one to look after her,
since I am giving so much time to my war
work I am having to neglect my family."</p>

<p>Olive flushed slightly. She knew Frank
had not intended it, could not dream how
sensitive Captain MacDonnell was over the
thought that he could no longer be of service
to his country at a time when she so required
the knowledge and effort he had once been
so gallantly ready and able to give.</p>

<p>"Oh, I shall be at home the greater part
of the time, and Bryan whenever it is possible
for him," Olive answered quickly. "But
Bryan has already promised to begin <i>camouflage</i>
work for the government within the
next few days. We were not in London very
long, but were there long enough to see a
few of Bryan's old friends. They asked him
if he would not have his commission transferred
to the camouflage corps, as they
needed him at once. I suppose he will be
able to do some of the painting here in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
England. But later Bryan will probably
have to go over to France to find out what is
required of him."</p>

<p>"Bully, Bryan! I had not thought of
that," Lord Kent answered, appearing as
tremendously gratified as if he himself had
first conceived the idea of this work for his
friend. He went on to explain to his mystified
hearers that <i>camouflage</i> consisted of painted
artificial scenery used to conceal artillery or
other important positions from the enemy
airplanes, and that Bryan was especially fitted
to engage in this work on account of his military
knowledge and artistic ability.</p>

<p>But at this moment Jean and Ralph Merritt
joined the little group.</p>

<p>No one spoke of Frieda's being the last to
appear, since this had always been her custom
so long as the other Ranch Girls could recall.</p>

<p>Jean Merritt wore her favorite rose color, a
dress of satin with an overdress of tulle. And
in spite of all the flowers blooming in Kent
garden, Ralph had not forgotten to bring her
a box from London of the deep pink roses she
had always loved.</p>

<p>However, before dinner was announced the
Professor strolled placidly in, garbed in entirely
proper evening clothes.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span></p>

<p>"Frieda says if you will be kind enough
to wait dinner for her a few moments, she
will be with you almost at once. There was
some little errand, some little commission she
still wished to attend to before we leave the
library."</p>

<p>The Professor sat quietly down, asked
Frank Kent an important question concerning
the war and straightway fell into earnest
conversation.</p>

<p>However Frieda did make her appearance
within a short time. She was dainty and
lovely as ever in a misty, pale blue gown, but,
unlike her usual self, she seemed a little
embarrassed and apologetic.</p>

<p>The four Ranch Girls and their husbands
went into dinner together. Perhaps it was
absurd that they should feel any especial
emotion over so simple a matter as having
their first dinner party with one another since
their marriages.</p>

<p>Nevertheless it was true that each girl in
her own fashion did feel this emotion.</p>

<p>Since Jack's and Jean's few moments in
the dining room some hours before, a slight
change had taken place in the decoration of
the table.</p>

<p>Two little silk flags stood near the center;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
as a matter of course under the present circumstances,
they were the American and the
British emblems.</p>

<p>Lord Kent saluted before he sat down,
nodding to Captain MacDonnell.</p>

<p>"To our international marriages!" he said.
"Long may they wave!"</p>

<p>Then he turned to Frieda and Jean, the
Professor and Ralph.</p>

<p>"And to our great American Ally!"</p>

<p>As the little party took their seats they
observed a small white velvet box near each
plate.</p>

<p>Jack opened hers first and discovered inside
a tiny pair of crossed flags set with jewels.</p>

<p>Glancing toward her husband, Lady Kent
discovered that he appeared as surprised as she
was at the unexpected souvenir of their dinner.</p>

<p>Then she chanced to catch sight of Frieda
and Frieda's self-conscious expression betrayed
her. Moreover, her mission to London
was explained.</p>

<p>"I move," announced the Professor gravely,
"that we offer a toast first to our wives and
then to that beautiful and enduring land
which has ever made the appeal of a woman
to her lovers the world over. I mean, of
course, 'La belle France'."</p>

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
